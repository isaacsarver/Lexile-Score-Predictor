A FEW MILES south of Soledad, the Salinas 
River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs 
deep and green. The water is warm too, for it 
has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in 
the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool. 
On one side of the river the golden foothill 
slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan 
mountains, but on the valley side the water is 
lined with trees— willows fresh and green with 
every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junc- 
tures the debris of the winter’s flooding and 
sycamores with mottled, white, recumbent limbs 
and branches that arch over the pool. On the 
sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep 
and so crisp that a lizard makes a great skitter- 
ing if he runs among them. Rabbits come out of 


OF MICE AND MEN 


the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and 
the damp fiats are covered with the night tracks 
of ’coons, and with the spread pads of dogs from 
the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of 
deer that come to drink in the dark. 

There is a path through the willows and 
among the sycamores, a path beaten hard by 
boys coming down from the ranches to swim in 
the deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who 
come wearily down from the highway in the 
evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the 
low horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there 
is an ash pile made by many fires; the limb is 
worn smooth by men who have sat on it. 

Evening of a hot day started the little wind to 
moving among the leaves. The shade climbed up 
the hills toward the top. On the sand banks the 
rabbits sat as quietly as little gray, sculptured 
stones. And then from the direction of the state 
highway came the sound of footsteps on crisp 
sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly 
8 


OF MICE AND MEN 


for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the 
air and pounded down river. For a moment the 
place was lifeless, and then two men emerged 
from the path and came into the opening by the 
green pool. 

They had walked in single file down the 
path, and even in the open one stayed behind 
the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers 
and in denim coats with brass buttons. Both 
wore black, shapeless hats and both carried 
tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The 
first man was small and quick, dark of face, 
with restless eyes and sharp, strong features. 
Every part of him was defined: small, strong 
hands, slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Be- 
hind him walked his opposite, a huge man, shape- 
less of face, with large, pale eyes, with wide, slop- 
ing shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging 
his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws. 
His arms did not swing at his sides, but hung 
loosely. 

The first man stopped short in the clearing, 

9 


OF MICE AND MEN 


and the follower nearly ran over him. He took 
off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his 
forefinger and snapped the moisture off. His 
huge companion dropped his blankets and flung 
himself down and drank from the surface of the 
green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into 
the water like a horse. The small man stepped 
nervously beside him. 

“Lennie!” he said sharply. “Lennie, for God’ 
sakes don’t drink so much.” Lennie continued 
to snort into the pool. The small man leaned 
over and shook him by the shoulder. “Lennie. 
You gonna be sick like you was last night.” 

Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and 
all, and then he sat up on the bank and his hat 
dripped down on his blue coat and ran down his 
back. “Tha’s good,” he said. “You drink some, 
George. You take a good big drink.” He smiled 
happily. 

George unslung his bindle and dropped it 
gently on the bank. “I ain’t sure it’s good water,” 
he said. “Looks kinda scummy.” 


io

Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and 
wiggled his fingers so the water arose in little 
splashes; rings widened across the pool to the 
other side and came back again. Lennie watched 
them go. “Look, George. Look what I done.” 

George knelt beside the pool and drank from 
his hand with quick scoops. “Tastes all right,” 
he admitted. “Don’t really seem to be running, 
though. You never oughta drink water when 
it ain’t running, Lennie,” he said hopelessly. 
“You’d drink out of a gutter if you was thirsty.” 
He threw a scoop of water into his face and 
rubbed it about with his hand, under his chin 
and around the back of his neck. Then he re- 
placed his hat, pushed himself back from the 
river, drew up his knees and embraced them. 
Lennie, who had been watching, imitated 
George exactly. He pushed himself back, drew 
up his knees, embraced them, looked over to 
George to see whether he had it just right. He 
pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, 
the way George’s hat was. 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George stared morosely at the water. The rims 
of his eyes were red with sun glare. He said 
angrily, “We could just as well of rode clear to 
the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what 
he was talkin’ about. ‘J es ’ a little stretch down 
the highway,’ he says. ‘J es> a little stretch.’ God 
damn near four miles, that’s what it was! Didn’t 
wanta stop at the ranch gate, that’s what. Too 
God damn lazy to pull up. Wonder he isn’t too 
damn good to stop in Soledad at all. Kicks us out 
and says, ‘J es ’ a little stretch down the road.’ 
I bet it was more than four miles. Damn hot 
day.” 

Lennie looked timidly over to him. “George?” 

“Yeah, what ya want?” 

“Where we goin’, George?” 

The little man jerked down the brim of his 
hat and scowled over at Lennie. “So you forgot 
that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do 
I? Jesus Christ, you’re a crazy bastard!” 

“I forgot,” Lennie said softly. “I tried not to 
forget. Honest to God I did, George.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“O.K.-O.K. I’ll tell ya again. I ain’t got noth- 
ing to do. Might jus’ as well spen’ all my time 
tellin’ you things and then you forget ’em, and 
I tell you again.” 

“Tried and tried,” said Lennie, “but it didn’t 
do no good. I remember about the rabbits, 
George.” 

“The hell with the rabbits. That’s all you ever 
can remember is them rabbits. O.K! Now you 
listen and this time you got to remember so we 
don’t get in no trouble. You remember settin’ 
in that gutter on Howard street and watchin’ 
that blackboard?” 

Lennie’s face broke into a delighted smile. 
“Why sure, George. I remember that , . . . but 
.... what’d we do then? I remember some girls 
come by and you says .... you say . . . .” 

“The hell with what I says. You remember 
about us goin’ into Murray and Ready’s, and 
they give us work cards and bus tickets?” 

“Oh, sure, George. I remember that now.” 
His hands went quickly into his side coat pock- 

13 


OF MICE AND MEN 

ets. He said gently, “George .... I ain’t got 
mine. I musta lost it.” He looked down at the 
ground in despair. 

“You never had none, you crazy bastard. I 
got both of ’em here. Think I’d let you carry 
your own work card?” 

Lennie grinned with relief. “I .... I thought 
I put it in my side pocket.” His hand went into 
the pocket again. 

George looked sharply at him. “What’d you 
take outa that pocket?” 

“Ain’t a thing in my pocket,” Lennie said 
cleverly. 

“I know there ain’t. You got it in your hand. 
What you got in your hand— hidin’ it?” 

“I ain’t got nothin’, George. Honest.” 

“Come on, give it here.” 

Lennie held his closed hand away from 
George’s direction. “It’s on’y a mouse, George.” 

“A mouse? A live mouse?” 

“Uh-uh. Jus’ a dead mouse, George. I didn’ 
kill it. Honest! I found it. I found it dead.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Give it here!” said George. 

“Aw, leave me have it, George.” 

“ Give it here!” 

Lennie’s closed hand slowly obeyed. George 
took the mouse and threw it across the pool to 
the other side, among the brush. “What you 
want of a dead mouse, anyways?” 

“I could pet it with my thumb while we 
walked along,” said Lennie. 

“Well, you ain’t petting no mice while you 
walk with me. You remember where we’re goin’ 
.now?” '' ' ' 

Lennie looked startled and then in embarrass- 
ment hid his face against his knees. “I forgot 
again.” 

“Jesus Christ,” George said resignedly. “Well 
—look, we’re gonna work on a ranch like the one 
we come from up north.” 

“Up north?” 

“In Weed.” 

“Oh, sure. I remember. In Weed.” 

“That ranch we’re goin’ to is right down 

z 5 



OF MICE AND MEN 


there about a quarter mile. We’re gonna go in 
an’ see the boss. Now, look— I’ll give him the 
work tickets, but you ain’t gonna say a word. 
You jus’ stand there and don’t say nothing. If 
he finds out what a crazy bastard you are, we 
won’t get no job, but if he sees ya work before 
he hears ya talk, we’re set. Ya got that?” 

“Sure, George. Sure I got it.” 

“O.K. Now when we go in to see the boss, 
what you gonna do?” 

“I . . . . I,” Lennie thought. His face grew 
tight with thought. “I . . . . ain’t gonna say 
nothin’. Jus’ gonna stan’ there.” 

“Good boy. That’s swell. You say that over 
two, three times so you sure won’t forget it.” 

Lennie droned to himself softly, “I ain’t gonna 
say nothin’ .... I ain’t gonna say nothin’ .... 
I ain’t gonna say nothin’.” 

“O.K.,” said George. “An’ you ain’t gonna do 
no bad things like you done in Weed, neither.” 

Lennie looked puzzled. “Like I done in 
Weed?” 

1 6 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Oh, so ya forgot that too, did ya? Well, I 
ain’t gonna remind ya, fear ya do it again.” 

A light of understanding broke on Lennie’s 
v face. “They run us outa Weed,” he exploded 
; triumphantly. 

“Run us out, hell,” said George disgustedly. 
“We run. They was lookin’ for us, but they 
didn’t catch us.” 

I Lennie giggled happily. “I didn’t forget that, 
you bet.” 

George lay back on the sand and crossed his 
hands under his head, and Lennie imitated him, 

1 raising his head to see whether he were doing it 
right. “God, you’re a lot of trouble,” said 
George. “I could get along so easy and so nice 
if I didn’t have you on my tail. I could live so 
f easy and maybe have a girl.” 

For a moment Lennie lay quiet, and then he 
said hopefully, “We gonna work on a ranch, 
George.” 

“Awright. You got that. But we’re gonna 
it sleep here because I got a reason.”

The day was going fast now. Only the tops 
of the Gabilan mountains flamed with the light 
of the sun that had gone from the valley. A 
water snake slipped along on the pool, its head 
held up like a little periscope. The reeds jerked 
slightly in the current. Far off toward the high- 
way a man shouted something, and another man 
shouted back. The sycamore limbs rustled under 
a little wind that died immediately. 

“George— why ain’t we goin’ on to the ranch 
and get some supper? They got supper at the 
ranch.” 

George rolled on his side. “No reason at all 
for you. I like it here. Tomorra we’re gonna go 
to work. I seen thrashin’ machines on the way 
down. That means we’ll be bucking grain bags, 
bustin’ a gut. Tonight I’m gonna lay right here 
and look up. I like it.” 

Lennie got up on his knees and looked down 
at George. “Ain’t we gonna have no supper?” 

“Sure we are, if you gather up some dead wil- 
low sticks. I got three cans of beans in my 
18 


OF MICE AND MEN 


bindle. You get a fire ready. I’ll give you a 
match when you get the sticks together. Then 
we’ll heat the beans and have supper.” 

Lennie said, “I like beans with ketchup.” 

“Well, we ain’t got no ketchup. You go get 
wood. An’ don’t you fool around. It’ll be dark 
before long.” 

Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared 
in the brush. George lay where he was and 
whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of 
splashings down the river in the direction Len- 
nie had taken. George stopped whistling and 
listened. “Poor bastard,” he said softly, and then 
went on whistling again. 

In a moment Lennie came crashing back 
through the brush. He carried one small willow 
stick in his hand. George sat up. “Awright,” 
he said brusquely. “Gi’me that mouse!” 

But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of 
innocence. “What mouse, George? I ain’t got 
no mouse.” 

George held out his hand. “Come on. Give it 
to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.”

Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly 
at the brush line as though he contemplated run- 
ning for his freedom. George said coldly, “You 
gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock 
you?” 

“Give you what, George?” 

“You know God damn well what. I want that 
mouse.” 

Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. 
His voice broke a little. “I don’t know why I 
can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t 
steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road.” 

George’s hand remained outstretched imperi- 
ously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want 
to bring a ball to its master, Lennie approached, 
drew back, approached again. George snapped 
his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid 
the mouse in his hand. 

“I wasn’t doin’ nothing bad with it, George. 
Jus’ strokin’ it.” 

George stood up and threw the mouse as far 
as he could into the darkening brush, and then

he stepped to the pool and washed his hands. 
“You crazy fool. Don’t you think I could see 
your feet was wet where you went acrost the 
river to get it?” He heard Lennie’s whimpering 
cry and wheeled about. “Blubberin’ like a baby! 
Jesus Christ! A big guy like you.” Lennie’s lip 
quivered and tears started in his eyes. “Aw, Len- 
nie!” George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. 
“I ain’t takin’ it away jus’ for meanness. That 
mouse ain’t fresh, Lennie; and besides, you’ve 
broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s 
fresh and I’ll let you keep it a little while.” 

Lennie sat down on the ground and hung his 
head dejectedly. “I don’t know where there is 
no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give 
’em to me— ever’ one she got. But that lady ain’t 
here.” 

George scoffed. “Lady, huh? Don’t even re- 
member who that lady was. That was your own 
Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ ’em to ya. 
You always killed ’em.” 

Lennie looked sadly up at him. “They was so 


21 


OF MICE AND MEN 

little,” he said, apologetically. “I’d pet ’em, and 
pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched 
their heads a little and then they was dead— 
because they was so little.” 

“I wish’t we’d get the rabbits pretty soon, 
George. They ain’t so little.” 

“The hell with the rabbits. An’ you ain’t to 
be trusted with no live mice. Your Aunt Clara 
give you a rubber mouse and you wouldn’t have 
nothing to do with it.” 

“It wasn’t no good to pet,” said Lennie. 

The flame of the sunset lifted from the moun- 
taintops and dusk came into the valley, and a 
half darkness came in among the willows and 
the sycamores. A big carp rose to the surface of 
the pool, gulped air and then sank mysteriously 
into the dark water again, leaving widening 
rings on the water. Overhead the leaves whisked 
again and little puffs of willow cotton blew 
down and landed on the pool’s surface. 

“You gonna get that wood?” George de- 
manded. “There’s plenty right up against the 


OF MICE AND MEN 


back of that sycamore. Flood-water wood. Now 
you get it.” 

Lennie went behind the tree and brought out 
a litter of dried leaves and twigs. He threw 
them in a heap on the old ash pile and went back 
for more and more. It was almost night now. A 
dove’s wings whistled over the water. George 
walked to the fire pile and lighted the dry leaves. 
The flame cracked up among the twigs and fell 
to work. George undid his bindle and brought 
out three cans of beans. He stood them about 
the fire, close in against the blaze, but not quite 
touching the flame. 

“There’s enough beans for four men,” George 
said. 

Lennie watched him from over the fire. He 
said patiently, “I like ’em with ketchup.” 

“Well, we ain’t got any,” George exploded. 
“Whatever we ain’t got, that’s what you want. 
God a’mighty, if I was alone I could live so 
easy. I could go get a job an’ work, an’ no 
trouble. No mess at all, and when the end of the 


23 


OF MICE AND MEN 



I 


month come I could take my fifty bucks and go 
into town and get whatever I want. Why, I 
could stay in a cat house all night. I could eat 
any place I want, hotel or any place, and order 
any damn thing I could think of. An’ I could do 
all that every damn month. Get a gallon of 
whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or 
shoot pool.” Lennie knelt and looked over the 
fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was 
drawn with terror. “An’ whatta I got,” George 
went on furiously. “I got you! You can’t keep 
a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep 
me shovin’ all over the country all the time. An’ 
that ain’t the worst. You get in trouble. You do 
bad things and I got to get you out.” His voice 
rose nearly to a shout. “You crazy son-of-a- 
bitch. You keep me in hot water all the time.” 
He took on the elaborate manner of little girls 
when they are mimicking one another. “Jus’ 
wanted to feel that girl’s dress— jus’ wanted to 
pet it like it was a mouse — Well, how the hell 
did she know you jus’ wanted to feel her dress? 

24 




OF MICE AND MEN 


She jerks back and you hold on like it was a 
mouse. She yells and we got to hide in a irri- 
gation ditch all day with guys lookin’ for us, 
and we got to sneak out in the dark and get 
outta the country. All the time somethin’ like 
that— all the time. I wisht I could put you in a 
cage with about a million mice an’ let you have 
fun.” His anger left him suddenly. He looked 
across the fire at Lennie’s anguished face, and 
then he looked ashamedly at the flames. 

It was quite dark now, but the fire lighted 
the trunks of the trees and the curving branches 
overhead. Lennie crawled slowly and cautiously 
around the fire until he was close to George. He 
sat back on his heels. George turned the bean 
cans so that another side faced the fire. He pre- 
tended to be unaware of Lennie so close beside 
him. 

“George,” very softly. No answer. “George!” 

“Whatta you want?” 

“I was only foolin’, George. I don’t want no 
ketchup. I wouldn’t eat no ketchup if it was 
right here beside me.” 


2 5 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“If it was here, you could have some.” 

“But I wouldn’t eat none, George. I’d leave it 
all for you. You could cover your beans with it 
and I wouldn’t touch none of it.” 

George still stared morosely at the fire. 
“When I think of the swell time I could have 
without you, I go nuts. I never get no peace.” 

Lennie still knelt. He looked off into the dark- 
ness across the river. “George, you want I 
should go away and leave you alone?” 

“Where the hell could you go?” 

“Well, I could. I could go off in the hills there. 
Some place I’d find a cave.” 

“Yeah? How’d you eat. You ain’t got sense 
enough to find nothing to eat.” 

“I’d find things, George. I don’t need no nice 
food with ketchup. I’d lay out in the sun and 
nobody’d hurt me. An’ if I foun’ a mouse, I 
could keep it. Nobody’d take it away from me.” 

George looked quickly and searchingly at 
him. “I been mean, ain’t I?” 

“If you don’ want me I can go off in the hills 
2 6 


OF MICE AND MEN 


an’ find a cave. I can go away any time.” 

“No— look! I was jus’ foolin’, Lennie. ’Cause 
I want you to stay with me. Trouble with mice 
is you always kill ’em. ” He paused. “Tell you 
what I’ll do, Lennie. First chance I get I’ll give 
you a pup. Maybe you wouldn’t kill it. That’d 
be better than mice. And you could pet it 
harder.” 

Lennie avoided the bait. He had sensed his 
advantage. “If you don’t want me, you only jus’ 
got to say so, and I’ll go off in those hills right 
there— right up in those hills and live by myself. 
An’ I won’t get no mice stole from me.” 

George said, “I want you to stay with me, 
Lennie. Jesus Christ, somebody’d shoot you for 
a coyote if you was by yourself. No, you stay 
with me. Your Aunt Clara wouldn’t like you 
running off by yourself, even if she is dead.” 

Lennie spoke craftily, “Tell me— like you 
done before.” 

“TeH you what?” 

“About the rabbits.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George snapped, “You ain’t gonna put noth- 
ing over on me.” 

Lennie pleaded, “Come on, George. Tell me. 
Please, George. Like you done before.” 

“You get a kick outta that, don’t you? 
Awright, I’ll tell you, and then we’ll eat our 
supper. . . .” 

George’s voice became deeper. He repeated 
his words rhythmically as though he had said 
them many times before. “Guys like us, that 
work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the 
world. They got no family. They don’t belong 
no place. They come to a ranch an’ work up a 
stake and then they go inta town and blow their 
stake, and the first thing you know they’re 
poundin’ their tail on some other ranch. They 
ain’t got nothing to look ahead to.” 

Lennie was delighted. ‘That’s it— that’s it. 
Now tell how it is with us.” 

George went on. “With us it ain’t like that. 
We got a future. We got somebody to talk to 
28 


OF MICE AND MEN 


that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit 
in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because 
we got no place else to go. If them other guys 
gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a 
damn. But not us.” 

Lennie broke in. “But not us! An ’ why? Be- 
cause .... because I got you to look after me, 
and you got me to look after you , and that’s 
why .” He laughed delightedly. “Go on now, 
George!” 

“You got it by heart. You can do it yourself.” 

“No, you. I forget some a’ the things. Tell 
about how it’s gonna be.” 

“O.K. Someday— we’re gonna get the jack to- 
gether and we’re gonna have a little house and 
a couple of acres an’ a cow and some pigs 
and — ” 

“ An ’ live off the fatta the lan Lennie 
shouted. “An’ have rabbits. Go on, George! Tell 
about what we’re gonna have in the garden and 
about the rabbits in the cages and about the rain 
in the winter and the stove, and how thick the 


29 


OF MICE AND MEN 

cream is on the milk like you can hardly cut 
it. Tell about that, George.” 

“Why’n’t you do it yourself? You know all 
of it.” 

“No .... you tell it. It ain’t the same if I tell 
it. Go on ... . George. How I get to tend the 
rabbits.” 

“Well,” said George, “we’ll have a big vege- 
table patch and a rabbit hutch and chickens. 
And when it rains in the winter, we’ll just say 
the hell with goin’ to work, and we’ll build up a 
fire in the stove and set around it an’ listen to the 
rain cornin’ down on the roof-Nuts!” He took 
out his pocket knife. “I ain’t got time for no 
more.” He drove his knife through the top of 
one of the bean cans, sawed out the top and 
passed the can to Lennie. Then he opened a 
second can. From his side pocket he brought out 
two spoons and passed one of them to Lennie. 

They sat by the fire and filled their mouths 
with beans and chewed mightily. A few beans 
slipped out of the side of Lennie’s mouth.

George gestured with his spoon. “What you 
gonna say tomorrow when the boss asks you 
questions?” 

Lennie stopped chewing and swallowed. His 
face was concentrated. “I .... I ain’t gonna 
.... say a word.” 

“Good boy! That’s fine, Lennie! Maybe 
you’re gettin’ better. When we get the coupla 
acres I can let you tend the rabbits all right. 
’Specially if you remember as good as that.” 

Lennie choked with pride. “I can remember,” 
he said. 

George motioned with his spoon again. 
“Look, Lennie. I want you to look around here. 
You can remember this place, can’t you? The 
ranch is about a quarter mile up that way. Just 
follow the river?” 

“Sure,” said Lennie. “I can remember this. 
Di’n’t I remember about not gonna say a 
word?” 

“ ’Course you did. Well, look. Lennie— if you 
jus’ happen to get in trouble like you always 


OF MICE AND MEN 

done before, I want you to come right here an’ 
hide in the brush.” 

“Hide in the brush,” said Lennie slowly. 

“Hide in the brush till I come for you. Can 
you remember that?” 

“Sure I can, George. Hide in the brush till 
you come.” 

“But you ain’t gonna get in no trouble, be- 
cause if you do, I won’t let you tend the rab- 
bits.” He threw his empty bean can off into 
the brush. 

“I won’t get in no trouble, George. I ain’t 
gonna say a word.” 

“O.K. Bring your bindle over here by the 
fire. It’s gonna be nice sleepin’ here. Lookin’ up, 
and the leaves. Don’t build up no more fire. 
We’ll let her die down.” 

They made their beds on the sand, and as the 
blaze dropped from the fire the sphere of light 
grew smaller; the curling branches disappeared 
and only a faint glimmer showed where the tree 
trunks were. From the darkness Lennie called, 
“George— you asleep?” 

32 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“No. Whatta you want?” 

“Let’s have different color rabbits, George.” 

“Sure we will,” George said sleepily. “Red 
and blue and green rabbits, Lennie. Millions of 
em. 

“Furry ones, George, like I seen in the fair in 
Sacramento.” 

“Sure, furry ones.” 

“’Cause I can jus’ as well go away, George, 
an’ live in a cave.” 

“You can jus’ as well go to hell,” said 
George. “Shut up now.” 

The red light dimmed on the coals. Up the 
hill from the river a coyote yammered, and a 
dog answered from the other side of the stream. 
The sycamore leaves whispered in a little night 
breeze.

THE bunk house was a long, rectangular build- 
ing. Inside, the walls were whitewashed and the 
floor unpainted. In three walls there were small, 
square windows, and in the fourth, a solid door 
with a wooden latch. Against the wails were 
eight bunks, five of them made up with blankets 
and the other three showing their burlap ticking. 
Over each bunk there was nailed an apple box 
with the opening forward so that it made two 
shelves for the personal belongings of the oc- 
cupant of the bunk. And these shelves were 
loaded with little articles, soap and talcum pow- 
der, razors and those Western magazines ranch 
men love to read and scoff at and secretly be- 
lieve. And there were medicines on the shelves, 
and little vials, combs; and from nails on the 
34 


OF MICE AND MEN 


box sides, a few neckties. Near one wall there 
was a black cast-iron stove, its stovepipe going 
straight up through the ceiling. In the middle of 
the room stood a big square table littered with 
playing cards, and around it were grouped boxes 
for the players to sit on. 

At about ten o’clock in the morning the sun 
threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the 
side windows, and in and out of the beam flies 
shot like rushing stars. 

The wooden latch raised. The door opened 
and a tall, stoop-shouldered old man came in. 
He was dressed in blue jeans and he carried a 
big push-broom in his left hand. Behind him 
came George, and behind George, Lennie. 

“The boss was expectin’ you last night,” the 
old man said. “He was sore as hell when you 
wasn’t here to go out this morning.” He pointed 
with his right arm, and out of the sleeve came a 
round stick-like wrist, but no hand. “You can 
have them two beds there,” he said, indicating 
two bunks near the stove. 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George stepped over and threw his blankets 
down on the burlap sack of straw that was a 
mattress. He looked into his box shelf and then 
picked a small yellow can from it. “Say. What 
the hell’s this?” 

“I don’t know,” said the old man. 

“Says ‘positively kills lice, roaches and other 
scourges.’ What the hell kind of bed you giving 
us, anyways. We don’t want no pants rabbits.” 

The old swamper shifted his broom and held 
it between his elbow and his side while he held 
out his hand for the can. He studied the label 
carefully. “Tell you what—” he said finally, 
“last guy that had this bed was a blacksmith- 
hell of a nice fella and as clean -a guy as you 
want to meet. Used to wash his hands even 
after he ate.” 

“Then how come he got graybacks?” George 
was working up a slow anger. Lennie put his 
bindle on the neighboring bunk and sat down. 
He watched George with open mouth. 

“Tell you what,” said the old swamper. “ This 
36 


OF MICE AND MEN 


here blacksmith— name of Whitey— was the kind 
of guy that would put that stuff around even if 
there wasn’t no bugs— just to make sure, see? 
Tell you what he used to do— At meals he’d 
peel his boil’ potatoes, an’ he’d take out ever’ lit- 
tle spot, no matter what kind, before he’d eat it. 
And if there was a red splotch on an egg, he’d 
scrape it off. Finally quit about the food. That’s 
the kinda guy he was— clean. Used ta dress up 
Sundays even when he wasn’t going no place, 
put on a necktie even, and then set in the bunk- 
house.” '.--'A ip' AvV.v ' 

“I ain’t so sure,” said George skeptically. 
“What did you say he quit for?” 

The old man put the yellow can in his pocket, 
and he rubbed his bristly white whiskers with 
his knuckles. “Why .... he ... . just quit, the 
way a guy will. Says it was the food. Just 
wanted to move. Didn’t give no other reason 
but the food. Just says ‘gimme my time’ one 
night, the way any guy would.” 

George lifted his tick and looked underneath 

W- %-M: 


OF MICE AND MEN 


it. He leaned over and inspected the sacking 
closely. Immediately Lennie got up and did the 
same with his bed. Finally George seemed sat- 
isfied. He unrolled his bindle and put things on 
the shelf, his razor and bar of soap, his comb and 
bottle of pills, his liniment and leather wrist- 
band. Then he made his bed up neatly with 
blankets. The old man said, “I guess the boss’ll 
be out here in a minute. He was sure burned 
when you wasn’t here this morning. Come right 
in when we was eatin’ breakfast and says, 
‘Where the hell’s them new men?’ An’ he give 
the stable buck hell, too.” 

George patted a wrinkle out of his bed, and 
sat down. “Give the stable buck hell?” he asked. 

“Sure. Ya see the stable buck’s a nigger.” 

“Nigger, huh?” 

“Yeah. Nice fella too. Got a crooked back 
where a horse kicked him. The boss gives him 
hell when he’s mad. But the stable buck don’t 
give a damn about that. He reads a lot. Got 
books in his room.” 

38 


OF MICE AND MEN 



“What kind of a guy is the boss?” George 
asked. 

“Well, he’s a pretty nice fella. Gets pretty 
mad sometimes, but he’s pretty nice. Tell ya 
what— know what he done Christmas? Brang a 
gallon of whisky right in here and says, ‘Drink 
hearty boys. Christmas comes but once a year.’ ” 

“The hell he did! Whole gallon?” 

“Yes sir. Jesus, we had fun. They let the nig- 
ger come in that night. Little skinner name of 
Smitty took after the nigger. Done pretty good, 
too. The guys wouldn’t let him use his feet, so 
the nigger got him. If he coulda used his feet, 
Smitty says he woulda killed the nigger. The 
guys said on account of the nigger’s got a 
crooked back, Smitty can’t use his feet.” He 
paused in relish of the memory. “After that the 
guys went into Soledad and raised hell. I didn’t 
go in there. I ain’t got the poop no more.” 

Lennie was just finishing making his bed. The 
wooden latch raised again and the door opened. 
A little stocky man stood in the open doorway. 


OF MICE AND MEN 


He wore blue jean trousers, a flannel shirt, a 
black, unbuttoned vest and a black coat. His 
thumbs were stuck in his belt, on each side of 
a square steel buckle. On his head was a soiled 
brown Stetson hat, and he wore high-heeled 
boots and spurs to prove he was not a laboring 
man. 

The old swamper looked quickly at him, and 
then shuffled to the door rubbing his whiskers 
with his knuckles as he went. “Them guys just 
come,” he said, and shuffled past the boss and out 
the door. 

The boss stepped into the room with the 
short, quick steps of a fat-legged man. “I wrote 
Murray and Ready I wanted two men this 
morning. You got your work slips?” George 
reached into his pocket and produced the slips 
and handed them to the boss. “It wasn’t Murray 
and Ready’s fault. Says right here on the slip 
that you was to be here for work this morn- 
mg. 

George looked down at his feet. “Bus driver 
40 


OF MICE AND MEN 


give us a bum steer,” he said. “We hadda walk 
ten miles. Says we was here when we wasn’t. 
We couldn’t get no rides in the morning.” 

The boss squinted his eyes. “Well, I had to 
send out the grain teams short two buckers. 
Won’t do any good to go out now till after din- 
ner.” He pulled his time book out of his pocket 
and opened it where a pencil was stuck between 
the leaves. George scowled meaningfully at Len- 
nie, and Lennie nodded to show that he under- 
stood. The boss licked his pencil. “What’s your 
name?” 

“George Milton.” 

“And what’s yours?” 

George said, “His name’s Lennie Small.” 

The names were entered in the book. “Le’s 
see, this is the twentieth, noon the twentieth.” 
He closed the book. “Where you boys been 
working?” 

F “Up around Weed,” said George. 

I “You, too?” to Lennie. 

t “Yeah, him too,” said George. 


41 


OF MICE AND MEN 


The boss pointed a playful finger at Lennie. 
“He ain’t much of a talker, is he?” 

“No, he ain’t, but he’s sure a hell of a good 
worker. Strong as a bull.” 

Lennie smiled to himself. “Strong as a bull,” 
he repeated. 

George scowled at him, and Lennie dropped 
his head in shame at having forgotten. 

The boss said suddenly, “Listen, Small!” Len- 
nie raised his head. “What can you do?” 

In a panic, Lennie looked at George for help. 
“He can do anything you tell him,” said George. 
“He’s a good skinner. He can rassel grain bags, 
drive a cultivator. He can do anything. Just give 
him a try.” 

The boss turned on George. “Then why don’t 
you let him answer? What you trying to put 
over?” 

George broke in loudly, “Oh! I ain’t saying 
he’s bright. He ain’t. But I say he’s a God damn 
good worker. He can put up a four hundred 
pound bale.” 

42 


OF MICE AND MEN 


The boss deliberately put the little book in his 
pocket. He hooked his thumbs in his belt and 
squinted one eye nearly closed. “Say— what you 
sellin’?” 

“Huh?” 

“I said what stake you got in this guy? You 
talon’ his pay away from him?” 

“No, ’course I ain’t. Why ya think I’m sellin’ 
him out?” 

“Well, I never seen one guy take so much 
trouble for another guy. I just like to know 
what your interest is.” 

George said, “He’s my .... cousin. I told his 
old lady I’d take care of him. He got kicked in 
the head by a horse when he was a kid. He’s 
awright. Just ain’t bright. But he can do any- 
thing you tell him.” 

The boss turned half away. “Well, God 
knows he don’t need any brains to buck barley 
bags. But don’t you try to put nothing over, 
Milton. I got my eye on you. Why’d you quit 
in Weed?” 


43 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Job was done,” said George promptly. 

“What kinda job?” 

“We .... we was diggin’ a cesspool.” 

“All right. But don’t try to put nothing over, 
’cause you can’t get away with nothing. I seen 
wise guys before. Go on out with the grain 
teams after dinner. They’re pickin’ up barley at 
the threshing machine. Go out with Slim’s 
team.” 

“Slim?” 

“Yeah. Big tall skinner. You’ll see him at din- 
ner.” He turned abruptly and went to the door, 
but before he went out he turned and looked 
for a long moment at the two men. 

When the sound of his footsteps had died 
away, George turned on Lennie. “So you wasn’t 
gonna say a word. You was gonna leave your 
big flapper shut and leave me do the talkin’. 
Damn near lost us the job.” 

Lennie stared hopelessly at his hands. “I for- 
got, George.” 

“Yeah, you forgot. You always forget, an’ I 
44 


OF MICE AND MEN 


got to talk you out of it.” He sat down heavily 
on the bunk. “Now he’s got his eye on us. Now 
we got to be careful and not make no slips. You 
keep your big flapper shut after this.” He fell 
morosely silent. 

“George.” 

“What you want now?” 

“I wasn’t kicked in the head with no horse, 
was I, George?” 

“Be a damn good thing if you was,” George 
said viciously. “Save ever’body a hell of a lot 
of trouble.” 

“You said I was your cousin, George.” 

“Well, that was a lie. An’ I’m damn glad it 
was. If I was a relative of yours I’d shoot my- 
self.” He stopped suddenly, stepped to the open 
front door and peered out. “Say, what the hell 
you doin’ listenin’?” 

The old man came slowly into the room. He 
had his broom in his hand. And at his heels there 
walked a dragfooted sheepdog, gray of muzzle, 
and with pale, blind old eyes. The dog strug- 


OF MICE AND MEN 



gled lamely to the side of the room and lay 
down, grunting softly to himself and licking his 
grizzled, moth-eaten coat. The swamper 
watched him until he was settled. “I wasn’t lis- 
tenin’. I was jus’ standin’ in the shade a minute 
scratchin’ my dog. I jus’ now finished swampin’ 
out the wash house.” 

“You was pokin’ your big ears into our busi- 
ness,” George said. “I don’t like nobody to get 
nosey.” 

The old man looked uneasily from George to 
Lennie, and then back. “I jus’ come there,” he 
said. “I didn’t hear nothing you guys was sayin’. 

I ain’t interested in nothing you was sayin’. A 
guy on a ranch don’t never listen nor he don’t 
ast no questions.” 

“Damn right he don’t,” said George, slightly 
mollified, “not if he wants to stay workin’ long.” 
But he was reassured by the swamper’s defense. 
“Come on in and set down a minute,” he said. 
“That’s a hell of an old dog.” 

“Yeah. I had ’im ever since he was a pup. God, 

4 6 


OF MICE AND MEN 


he was a good sheep dog when he was younger.” 
He stood his broom against the wall and he 
rubbed his white bristled cheek with his 
knuckles. “How’d you like the boss?” he asked. 

“Pretty good. Seemed awright.” 

“He’s a nice fella,” the swamper agreed. “You 
got to take him right.” 

At that moment a young man came into the 
bunk house; a thin young man with a brown 
face, with brown eyes and a head of tightly 
curled hair. He wore a work glove on his left 
hand, and, like the boss, he wore high-heeled 
boots. “Seen my old man?” he asked. 

The swamper said, “He was here jus’ a minute 
ago, Curley. Went over to the cook house, I 
think.” 

“I’ll try to catch him,” said Curley. His eyes 
passed over the new men and he stopped. He 
glanced coldly at George and then at Lennie. 
His arms gradually bent at the elbows and his 
hands closed into fists. He stiffened and went 
into a slight crouch. His glance was at once 



OF MICE AND MEN 


calculating and pugnacious. Lennie squirmed un- 
der the look and shifted his feet nervously. 
Curley stepped gingerly close to him. “You 
the new guys the old man was waitin’ for?” 

“We just come in,” said George. 

“Let the big guy talk.” 

Lennie twisted with embarrassment. 

George said, “S’pose he don’t want to talk?” 

Curley lashed his body around. “By Christ, 
he’s gotta talk when he’s spoke to. What the 
hell are you gettin’ into it for?” 

“We travel together,” said George coldly. 

“Oh, so it’s that way.” 

George was tense, and motionless. “Yeah, it’s 
that way.” 

Lennie was looking helplessly to George for 
instruction. 

“An’ you won’t let the big guy talk, is that 
it?” 

“He can talk if he wants to tell you any- 
thing.” He nodded slightly to Lennie. 

“We jus’ come in,” said Lennie softly. 

48 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Curley stared levelly at him. “Well, nex’ time 
you answer when you’re spoke to.” He turned 
toward the door and walked out, and his elbows 
were still bent out a little. 

George watched him out, and then he turned 
back to the swamper. “Say, what the hell’s he 
got on his shoulder? Lennie didn’t do nothing 
to him.” 

The old man looked cautiously at the door to 
make sure no one was listening. “That’s the 
boss’s son,” he said quietly. “Curley’s pretty 
handy. He done quite a bit in the ring. He’s a 
lightweight, and he’s handy.” 

“Well, let him be handy,” said George. “He 
don’t have to take after Lennie. Lennie didn’t do 
nothing to him. What’s he got against Lennie?” 

The swamper considered. .... “Well tell 

you what. Curley’s like a lot of little guys. He 
hates big guys. He’s alia time picking scraps with 
big guys. Kind of like he’s mad at ’em because 
he ain’t a big guy. You seen little guys like that, 
ain’t you? Always scrappy?” 


49 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Sure,” said George. “I seen plenty tough lit- 
tle guys. But this Curley better not make no 
mistakes about Lennie. Lennie ain’t handy, but 
this Curley punk is gonna get hurt if he messes 
around with Lennie.” 

“Well, Curley’s pretty handy,” the swamper 
said skeptically. “Never did seem right to me. 
S’pose Curley jumps a big guy an’ licks him. 
Ever’body says what a game guy Curley is. And 
s’pose he does the same thing and gets licked. 
Then ever’body says the big guy oughtta pick 
somebody his own size, and maybe they gang 
up on the big guy. Never did seem right to me. 
Seems like Curley ain’t givin’ nobody a chance.” 

George was watching the door. He said omi- 
nously, “Well, he better watch out for Lennie. 
Lennie ain’t no fighter, but Lennie’s strong and 
quick and Lennie don’t know no rules.” He 
walked to the square table and sat down on one 
of the boxes. He gathered some of the cards 
together and shuffled them. 

The old man sat down on another box. 


OF MICE AND MEN 


w 


“Don’t tell Curley I said none of this. He’d 
slough me. He just don’t give a damn. Won’t 
ever get canned ’cause his old man’s the boss.” 

George cut the cards and began turning them 
over, looking at each one and throwing it down 
on a pile.' He said, “This guy Curley sounds like 
a son-of-a-bitch to me. I don’t like mean little 
guys.” 

“Seems to me like he’s worse lately,” said the 
swamper. “He got married a couple of weeks 
ago. Wife lives over in the boss’s house. Seems 
like Curley is cockier’n ever since he got mar- 
ried.” 

George grunted, “Maybe he’s showin’ off for 
his wife.” 

The swamper warmed to his gossip. “You 
seen that glove on his left hand?” 

“Yeah. I seen it.” 

I 

“Well, that glove’s fulla vaseline.” 

[ “Vaseline? What the hell for?” 

s “Well, I tell ya what— Curley says he’s keepin’ 

| that hand soft for his wife.” 


5 * 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George studied the cards absorbedly. “That’s 
a dirty thing to tell around,” he said. 

The old man was reassured. He had drawn a 
derogatory statement from George. He felt safe 
now, and he spoke more confidently. “Wait’ll 
you see Curley’s wife.” 

George cut the cards again and put out a soli- 
taire lay, slowly and deliberately. “Purty?” he 
asked casually. 

“Yeah. Purty .... but — ” 

George studied his cards. “But what?” 

“Well— she got the eye.” 

“Yeah? Married two weeks and got the eye? 
Maybe that’s why Curley’s pants is full of ants.” 

“I seen her give Slim the eye. Slim’s a jerk- 
line skinner. Hell of a nice fella. Slim don’t need 
to wear no high-heeled boots on a grain team. I 
seen her give Slim the eye. Curley never seen it. 
An’ I seen her give Carlson the eye.” 

George pretended a lack of interest. “Looks 
like we was gonna have fun.” 

The swamper stood up from his box. “Know 
52 


OF MICE AND MEN 


what I think?” George did not answer. “Well, 
I think Curley’s married .... a tart.” 

“He ain’t the first,” said George. “There’s 
plenty done that.” 

The old man moved toward the door, and his 
ancient dog lifted his head and peered about, and 
then got painfully to his feet to follow. “I gotta 
be settin’ out the wash basins for the guys. The 
teams’ll be in before long. You guys gonna 
buck barley?” 

“Yeah.” 

“You won’t tell Curley nothing I said?” 

“Hell no.” 

‘Well, you look her over, mister. You see if 
she ain’t a tart.” He stepped out the door into 
the brilliant sunshine. 

George laid down his cards thoughtfully, 
turned his piles of three. He built four clubs on 
his ace pile. The sun square was on the floor 
now, and the flies whipped through it like 
sparks. A sound of jingling harness and the 
croak of heavy-laden axles sounded from out- 


53 


OF MICE AND MEN 


side. From the distance came a clear call. “Stable 
Buck— ooh, sta-able Buck! And then, “Where 
the hell is that God damn nigger?” 

George stared at his solitaire lay, and then he 
flounced the cards together and turned around 
to Lennie. Lennie was lying down on the bunk 
watching him. 

“Look, Lennie! This here ain’t no set up. I’m 
scared. You gonna have trouble with that Cur- 
ley guy. I seen that kind before. He was kinda 
feelin’ you out. He figures he’s got you scared 
and he’s gonna take a sock at you the first 
chance he gets.” 

Lennie’s eyes were frightened. “I don’t want 
no trouble,” he said plaintively. “Don’t let him 
sock me, George.” 

George got up and went over to Lennie’s 
bunk and sat down on it. “I hate that kinda bas- 
tard,” he said. “I seen plenty of ’em. Like the 
old guy says, Curley don’t take no chances. He 
always wins.” He thought for a moment. “If he 
tangles with you, Lennie, we’re gonna get the 
54 


OF MICE AND MEN 


can. Don’t make no mistake about that. He’s 
the boss’s son. Look, Lennie. You tr y to keep 
away from him, will you? Don’t never speak to 
him. If he comes in here you move clear to the 
other side of the room. Will you do that, Len- 
nie?” 

“I don’t want no trouble,” Lennie mourned. 
“I never done nothing to him.” 

“Well, that won’t do you no good if Curley 
wants to plug himself up for a fighter. Just don’t 
have nothing to do with him. Will you remem- 
ber?” 

“Sure, George. I ain’t gonna say a word.” 

The sound of the approaching grain teams 
was louder, thud of big hooves on hard ground, 
drag of brakes and the jingle of trace chains. 
Men were calling back and forth from the 
teams. George, sitting on the bunk beside Len- 
nie, frowned as he thought. Lennie asked tim- 
idly, “You ain’t mad, George?” 

“I ain’t mad at you. I’m mad at this here Cur- 
ley bastard. I hoped we was gonna get a little 

55 


OF MICE AND MEN 


stake together— maybe a hundred dollars.” His 
tone grew decisive. “You keep away from Cur- 
ley, Lennie.” 

“Sure I will, George. I won’t say a word.” 

“Don’t let him pull you in— but— if the son- 
of-a-bitch socks you— let ’im have it.” 

“Let ’im have what, George?” 

“Never mind, never mind. I’ll tell you when. 
I hate that kind of a guy. Look, Lennie, if you 
get in any kind of trouble, you remember what 
I told you to do?” 

Lennie raised up on his elbow. His face con- 
torted with thought. Then his eyes moved sadly 
to George’s face. “If I get in any trouble, you 
ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.” 

“That’s not what I meant. You remember 
where we slep’ last night? Down by the river?” 

“Yeah. I remember. Oh, sure I remember! I 
go there an’ hide in the brush.” 

“Hide till I come for you. Don’t let nobody 
see you. Hide in the brush by the river. Say that 
over.” 

5<5 



OF MICE AND MEN 


“Hide in the brush by the river, down in the 
brush by the river.” 

“If you get in trouble.” 

“If I get in trouble.” 

A brake screeched outside. A call came, 
“Stable— Buck. Oh! Sta-able Buck.” 

George said, “Say it over to yourself, Lennie, 
so you won’t forget it.” 

Both men glanced up, for the rectangle of 
sunshine in the doorway was cut off. A girl was 
standing there looking in. She had full, rouged 
lips and wide-spaced eyes, heavily made up. Her 
fingernails were red. Her hair hung in little 
rolled clusters, like sausages. She wore a cotton 
house dress and red mules, on the insteps of 
which were little bouquets of red ostrich 
feathers. “I’m lookin’ for Curley,” she said. Her 
voice had a nasal, brittle quality. 

George looked away from her and then back. 
“He was in here a minute ago, but he went.” 

“Oh!” She put her hands behind her back and 
leaned against the door frame so that her body 

57 


OF MICE AND MEN 



was thrown forward. “You’re the new fellas 
that just come, ain’t ya?” 

“Yeah.” 

Lennie’s eyes moved down over her body, and 
though she did not seem to be looking at Lennie 
she bridled a little. She looked at her fingernails. 
“Sometimes Curley’s in here,” she explained. 

George said brusquely, “Well he ain’t now.” 

“If he ain’t, I guess I better look some place 
else,” she said playfully. 

Lennie watched her, fascinated. George said, 
“If I see him. I’ll pass the word you was look- 
ing for him.” 

She smiled archly and twitched her body. 
“Nobody can’t blame a person for lookin’,” she 
said. There were footsteps behind her, going by. 
She turned her head. “Hi, Slim,” she said. 

Slim’s voice came through the door. “Hi, 
Good-lookin’.” 

“I’m tryin’ to find Curley, Slim.” 

“Well, you ain’t tryin’ very hard. I seen him 
goin’ in your house.” 

58 ' 




OF MICE AND MEN 


She was suddenly apprehensive. “ ’Bye, boys,” 
she called into the bunk house, and she hurried 
away. 

George looked around at Lennie. “Jesus, what 
a tramp,” he said. “So that’s what Curley picks 
for a wife.” 

“She’s purty,” said Lennie defensively. 

“Yeah, and she’s sure hidin’ it. Curley got his 
work ahead of him. Bet she’d clear out for 
twenty bucks.” 

Lennie still stared at the doorway where she 
had been. “Gosh, she was purty.” He smiled 
admiringly. George looked quickly down at him 
and then he took him by an ear and shook him. 

“Listen to me, you crazy bastard,” he said 
fiercely. “Don’t you even take a look at that 
bitch. I don’t care what she says and what she 
does. I seen ’em poison before, but I never seen 
no piece of jail bait worse than her. You leave 
her be.” 

Lennie tried to disengage his ear. “I never 
done nothing, George.” 


59 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“No, you never. But when she was standin’ 
in the doorway showin’ her legs, you wasn’t 
lookin’ the other way, neither.” 

“I never meant no harm, George. Honest I 
never.” 

“Well, you keep away from her, ’cause she’s 
a rat-trap if I ever seen one. You let Curley take 
the rap. He let himself in for it. Glove fulla 
vaseline,” George said disgustedly. “An’ I bet 
he’s eatin’ raw eggs and writin’ to the patent 
medicine houses.” 

Lennie cried out suddenly— “I don’ like this 
place, George. This ain’t no good place. I wanna 
get outa here.” 

“We gotta keep it till we get a stake. We 
can t help it, Lennie. We’ll get out jus’ as soon 
as we can. I don’t like it no better than you do.” 
He went back to the table and set out a new 
solitaire hand. “No, I don’t like it,” he said. 
“For two bits I’d shove out of here. If we can 
get jus’ a few dollars in the poke we’ll shove off 
and go up the American River and pan gold.

We can make maybe a couple of dollars a day 
there, and we might hit a pocket.” 

Lennie leaned eagerly toward him. “Le’s go, 
George. Le’s get outta here. It’s mean here.” 

“We gotta stay,” George said shortly. “Shut 
up now. The guys’ll be cornin’ in.” 

From the washroom nearby came the sound 
of running water and rattling basins. George 
studied the cards. “Maybe we oughtta wash up,” 
he said. “But we ain’t done nothing to get 
dirty.” 

A tall man stood in the doorway. He held a 
crushed Stetson hat under his arm while he 
combed his long, black, damp hair straight back. 
Like the others he wore blue jeans and a short 
denim jacket. When he had finished combing his 
hair he moved into the room, and he moved with 
a majesty only achieved by royalty and master 
craftsmen. He was a jerkline skinner, the prince 
of the ranch, capable of driving ten, sixteen, 
even twenty mules with a single line to the lead- 
ers. He was capable of killing a fly on the 

61 


OF MICE AND MEN 

wheeler’s butt with a bull whip without touch- 
ing the mule. There was a gravity in his manner 
and a quiet so profound that all talk stopped 
when he spoke. His authority was so great that 
his word was taken on any subject, be it politics 
or love. This was Slim, the jerkline skinner. His 
hatchet face was ageless. He might have been 
thirty-five or fifty. His ear heard more than was 
said to him, and his slow speech had overtones 
not of thought, but of understanding beyond 
thought. His hands, large and lean, were as deli- 
cate in their action as those of a temple dancer. 

He smoothed out his crushed hat, creased it in 
the middle and put it on. He looked kindly at 
the two in the bunk house. “It’s brighter’n a 
bitch outside, he said gently. “Can’t hardly see 
nothing in here. You the new guys?” 

“Just come,” said George. 

“Gonna buck barley?” 

“That’s what the boss says.” 

Slim sat down on a box across the table from 
George. He studied the solitaire hand that was 
62 


OF MICE AND MEN 


upside down to him. “Hope you get on my 
team,” he said. His voice was very gentle. “I 
gotta pair of punks on my team that don’t know 
a barley bag from a blue ball. You guys ever 
bucked any barley?” 

“Hell, yes,” said George. “I ain’t nothing to 
scream about, but that big bastard there can put 
up more grain alone than most pairs can.” 

Lennie, who had been following the conver- 
sation back and forth with his eyes, smiled 
complacently at the compliment. Slim looked ap- 
provingly at George for having given the com- 
pliment. He leaned over the table and snapped 
the comer of a loose card. “You guys travel 
around together?” His tone was friendly. It 
invited confidence without demanding it. 

“Sure,” said George. “We kinda look after 
each other.” He indicated Lennie with his 
thumb. “He ain’t bright. Hell of a good worker, 
though. Hell of a nice fella, but he ain’t bright. 
I’ve knew him for a long time.” 

Slim looked through George and beyond him. 

63 

1 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Ain’t many guys travel around together,” he 
mused. “I don’t know why. Maybe ever’body 
in the whole damn world is scared of each 
other.” 

“It’s a lot nicer to go around with a guy you 
know,” said George. 

A powerful, big-stomached man came into 
the bunk house. His head still dripped water 
from the scrubbing and dousing. “Hi, Slim,” he 
said, and then stopped and stared at George and 
Lennie. 

“These guys jus’ come,” said Slim by way of 
introduction. 

“Glad ta meet ya,” the big man said. “My 
name’s Carlson.” 

“I’m George Milton. This here’s Lennie 
Small.” 

“Glad ta meet ya,” Carlson said again. “He 
ain’t very small.” He chuckled softly at his 
joke. “Ain’t small at all,” he repeated. “Meant 
to ask you, Slim— how’s your bitch? I seen she 
wasn’t under your wagon this morning.” 

<4 ' 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“She slang her pups last night,” said Slim. 
“Nine of ’em. I drowned four of ’em right off. 
She couldn’t feed that many.” 

“Got five left, huh?” 

“Yeah, five. I kept the biggest.” 

“What kinda dogs you think they’re gonna 
be?” 

“I dunno,” said Slim. “Some kinda shepherds, 
I guess. That’s the most kind I seen around here 
when she was in heat.” 

Carlson went on, “Got five pups, huh. Gonna 
keep all of ’em?” 

“I dunno. Have to keep ’em a while so they 
can drink Lulu’s milk.” 

Carlson said thoughtfully, “Well, looka here, 
Slim. I been thinkin’. That dog of Candy’s is so 
God damn old he can’t hardly walk. Stinks like 
hell, too. Ever’ time he comes into the bunk 
house I can smell him for two, three days. 
Why’n’t you get Candy to shoot his old dog and 
give him one of the pups to raise up? I can smell 
that dog a mile away. Got no teeth, damn near 

65 


OF MICE AND MEN 

blind, can’t eat. Candy feeds him milk. He can’t 
chew nothing else.” 

George had been staring intently at Slim. Sud- 
denly a triangle began to ring outside, slowly at 
first, and then faster and faster until the beat of 
it disappeared into one ringing sound. It stopped 
as suddenly as it had started. 

“There she goes,” said Carlson. 

Outside, there was a burst of voices as a group 
of men went by. 

Slim stood up slowly and with dignity. “You 
guys better come on while they’s still something 
to eat. Won’t be nothing left in a couple of min- 
utes.” 

Carlson stepped back to let Slim precede him, 
and then the two of them went out the door. 

Lennie was watching George excitedly. 
George rumpled his cards into a messy pile. 
“Yeah!” George said, “I heard him, Lennie. I’ll 
ask him.” 

A brown and white one,” Lennie cried ex- 
citedly. 



OF MICE AND MEN 

“Come on. Le’s get dinner. I don’t know 
whether he got a brown and white one.” 

Lennie didn’t move from his bunk. “You ask 
him right away, George, so he won’t kill no 
more of ’em.” 

“Sure. Come on now, get up on your feet.” 

Lennie rolled off his bunk and stood up, and 
the two of them started for the door. Just as 
they reached it, Curley bounced in. 

“You seen a girl around here?” he demanded 
angrily. 

George said coldly. “ ’Bout half an hour ago 
maybe.” 

“Well what the hell was she doin’? ” 

George stood still, watching the angry little 
man. He said insultingly, "She said— she was 
lookin’ for you.” 

Curley seemed really to see George for the 
first time. His eyes flashed over George, took in 
his height, measured his reach, looked at his trim 
middle. “Well, which way’d she go?” he de- 
manded at last. 


67 


OF MICE AND MEN 

“I dunno,” said George. “I didn’ watch her 

^ 55 

go. 

Curley scowled at him, and turning, hurried 
out the door. 

George said, “Ya know, Lennie, I’m scared 
I’m gonna tangle with that bastard myself. I 
hate his guts. Jesus Christ! Come on. They 
won’t be a damn thing left to eat.” 

They went out the door. The sunshine lay 
in a thin line under the window. From a distance 
there could be heard a rattle of dishes. 

After a moment the ancient dog walked 
lamely in through the open door. He gazed 
about with mild, half-blind eyes. He sniffed, and 
then lay down and put his head between his 
paws. Curley popped into the doorway again 
and stood looking into the room. The dog raised 
his head, but when Curley jerked out, the griz- 
zled head sank to the floor again. 


68 


ALTHOUGH there was evening brightness 
showing through the windows of the bunk 
house, inside it was dusk. Through the open 
door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a 
horseshoe game, and now and then the sound 
of voices raised in approval or derision. 

Slim and George came into the darkening 
bunkhouse together. Slim reached up over the 
card table and turned on the tin-shaded electric 
light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, 
and the cone of the shade threw its brightness 
straight downward, leaving the comers of the 
bunk house still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box 
and George took his place opposite. 

“It wasn’t nothing,” said Slim. “I would of 
had to drowned most of ’em anyways. No need 
to thank me about that.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George said, “It wasn’t much to you, maybe, 
but it was a hell of a lot to him. Jesus Christ, I 
don’t know how we’re gonna get him to sleep in 
here. He’ll want to sleep right out in the bam 
with ’em. We’ll have trouble keepin’ him from 
getting right in the box with them pups.” 

“It wasn’t nothing,” Slim repeated. “Say, you 
sure was right about him. Maybe he ain’t bright, 
but I never seen such a worker. He damn near 
killed his partner buckin’ barley. There ain’t 
nobody can keep up with him. God awmighty 
I never seen such a strong guy.” 

George spoke proudly. “Jus’ tell Lennie what 
to do an’ he’ll do it if it don’t take no figuring. 
He can’t think of nothing to do himself, but he 
sure can take orders.” 

There was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake 
outside and a little cheer of voices. 

Slim moved back slightly so the light was not 
on his face. “Funny how you an’ him string 
along together.” It was Slim’s calm invitation to 
confidence. 


70 



OF MICE AND MEN 

“What’s funny about it?” George demanded 
defensively. 

“Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever 
travel together. I hardly never seen two guys 
travel together. You know how the hands are, 
they just come in and get their bunk and work 
a month, and then they quit and go out alone. 
Never seem to give a damn about nobody. It 
jus’ seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a 
smart little guy like you travelin’ together.” 

“He ain’t no cuckoo,” said George. “He’s 
dumb as hell, but he ain’t crazy. An’ I ain’t so 
bright neither, or I wouldn’t be buckin’ barley 
for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was 
even a little bit smart, I’d have my own little 
place, an’ I’d be bringin’ in my own crops, ’stead 
of doin’ all the work and not getting what comes 
up outa the ground.” George fell silent. He 
wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor dis- 
couraged him. He just sat back quiet and recep- 
tive. 

“It ain’t so funny, him an’ me goin’ aroun’ to- 


OF MICE AND MEN 


gether,” George said at last. “Him and me was 
both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt Clara. 
She took him when he was a baby and raised him 
up. When his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come 
along with me out workin’. Got kinda used to 
each other after a little while.” 

“Umm,” said Slim. 

George looked over at Slim and saw the calm, 
God-like eyes fastened on him. “Funny,” said 
George. “I used to have a hell of a lot of fun 
with ’im. Used to play jokes on ’im ’cause he was 
too dumb to take care of ’imself. But he was too 
dumb even to know he had a joke played on 
him. I had fun. Made me seem God damn smart 
alongside of him. Why he’d do any damn thing 
I tol’ him. If I tol’ him to walk over a cliff, over 
he’d go. That wasn’t so damn much fun after a 
while. He never got mad about it, neither. I’ve 
beat the hell outa him, and he coulda bust every 
bone in my body jus’ with his han’s, but he 
never lifted a finger against me.” George’s voice 
was taking on the tone of confession. “Tell you 
7 2 


OF MICE AND MEN 


what made me stop that. One day a bunch of 
guys was standin’ around up on the Sacramento 
River. I was feelin’ pretty smart. I turns to Len- 
nie and says, ‘Jump in.’ An’ he jumps. Couldn’t 
swim a stroke. He damn near drowned before 
we could get him. An’ he was so damn nice to 
me for pullin’ him out. Clean forgot I told him 
- to jump in. Well, I ain’t done nothing like that 
no more.” 

“He’s a nice fella,” said Slim. “Guy don’t 
need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me 
sometimes it jus’ works the other way around. 
Take a real smart guy and he ain’t hardly ever 
a nice fella.” 

George stacked the scattered cards and began 
to lay out his solitaire hand. The shoes thudded 
on the ground outside. At the windows the light 
of the evening still made the window squares 
bright. 

“I ain’t got no people,” George said. “I seen 
the guys that go around on the ranches alone. 
That ain’t no good. They don’t have no fun. 

73 


OF MICE AND MEN 


After a long time they get mean. They get 
wantin’ to fight all the time.” 

“Yeah, they get mean,” Slim agreed. “They 
get so they don’t want to talk to nobody.” 

“ ’Course Lennie’s a God damn nuisance most 
of the time,” said George. “But you get used to 
goin’ around with a guy an’ you can’t get rid of 
him.” 

“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can see Len- 
nie ain’t a bit mean.” 

“ ’Course he ain’t mean. But he gets in trouble 
alia time because he’s so God damn dumb. Like 
what happened in Weed — ” He stopped, 
stopped in the middle of turning over a card. 
He looked alarmed and peered over at Slim. 
“You wouldn’t tell nobody?” 

“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked calmly. 

“You wouldn’ tell? .... No, ’course you 
wouldn’.” 

“What’d he do in Weed?” Slim asked again. 

“Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb 
bastard like he is, he wants to touch ever’thing 
74 






OF MICE AND MEN 

he likes. Just wants to feel it. So he reaches out 
to feel this red dress an’ the girl lets out a 
squawk, and that gets Lennie all mixed up, and 
he holds on ’cause that’s the only thing he can 
think to do. Well, this girl squawks and 
squawks. I was jus’ a little bit off, and I heard 
all the yellin’, so I comes running, an’ by that 
time Lennie’s so scared all he can think to do is 
jus’ hold on. I socked him over the head with a 
fence picket to make him let go. He was so 
scairt he couldn’t let go of that dress. And he’s 
so God damn strong, you know.” 

Slim’s eyes were level and unwinking. He 
nodded very slowly. “So what happens?” 

George carefully built his line of solitaire 
cards. “Well, that girl rabbits in an’ tells the law 
she been raped. The guys in Weed start a party 
out to lynch Lennie. So we sit in a irrigation 
ditch under water all the rest of that day. Got 
on’y our heads sticking outa water, an’ up under 
the grass that sticks out from the side of the 
ditch. An’ that night we scrammed outa there.” 

75 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Slim sat in silence for a moment. “Didn’t hurt 
the girl none, huh?” he asked finally. 

“Hell, no. He just seated her. I’d be scared 
too if he grabbed me. But he never hurt her. 
He jus’ wanted to touch that red dress, like he 
wants to pet them pups all the time.” 

“He ain’t mean,” said Slim. “I can tell a mean 
guy a mile off.” 

“ ’Course he ain’t, and he’ll do any damn thing 
I — ” 

Lennie came in through the door. He wore 
his blue denim coat over his shoulders like a 
cape, and he walked hunched way over. 

“Hi, Lennie,” said George. “How you like the 
pup now?” 

Lennie said breathlessly, “He’s brown an’ 
white jus’ like I wanted.” He went directly to 
his bunk and lay down and turned his face to the 
wall and drew up his knees. 

George put down his cards very deliberately. 
“Lennie,” he said sharply. 

Lennie twisted his neck and looked over his 
shoulder. “Huh? What you want, George?” 

7 6 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“I tol’ you you couldn’t bring that pup in 
here.” 

“What pup, George? I ain’t got no pup.” 

George went quickly to him, grabbed him by 
the shoulder and rolled him over. He reached 
down and picked the tiny puppy from where 
Lennie had been concealing it against his 
stomach. 

Lennie sat up quickly. “Give ’um to me, 
George.” 

George said, “You get right up an’ take this 
pup back to the nest. He’s gotta sleep with his 
mother. You want to kill him? Just bom last 
night an’ you take him out of the nest. You 
take him back or I’ll tell Slim not to let you have 
him.” 

Lennie held out his hands pleadingly. “Give 
’um to me, George. I’ll take ’um back. I didn’t 
mean no harm, George. Honest I didn’t. I jus’ 
wanted to pet ’um a little.” 

George handed the pup to him. “Awright. 
You get him back there quick, and don’t you 


OF MICE AND MEN 


take him out no more. You’ll kill him, the first 
thing you know.” Lennie fairly scuttled out of 
the room. 

Slim had not moved. His calm eyes followed 
Lennie out the door. “Jesus,” he said. “He’s jes’ 
like a kid, ain’t he.” 

“Sure he’s jes’ like a kid. There ain’t no more 
harm in him than a kid neither, except he’s so 
strong. I bet he won’t come in here to sleep to- 
night. He’d sleep right alongside that box in the 
bam. Well— let ’im. He ain’t doin’ no harm out 
there.” 

It was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, 
the swamper, came in and went to his bunk, and 
behind him struggled his old dog. “Hello, Slim. 
Hello, George. Didn’t neither of you play horse- 
shoes?” 

“I don’t like to play ever’ night,” said Slim. 

Candy went on, “Either you guys got a slug 
of whisky? I gotta gut ache.” 

“I ain’t,” said Slim. “I’d drink it myself if I 
had, an’ I ain’t got a gut ache neither.” 

78 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Gotta bad gut ache,” said Candy. “Them 
God damn turnips give it to me. I knowed they 
was going to before I ever eat ’em.” 

The thick-bodied Carlson came in out of the 
darkening yard. He walked to the other end of 
the bunk house and turned on the second shaded 
light. “Darker’n hell in here,” he said. “Jesus, 
how that nigger can pitch shoes.” 

“He’s plenty good,” said Slim. 

“Damn right he is,” said Carlson. “He don’t 
give nobody else a chance to win — ” He 
stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, 
looked down at the old dog. “God awmighty, 
that dog stinks. Get him outa here. Candy! I 
don’t know nothing that stinks as bad as an old 
dog. You gotta get him out.” 

Candy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He 
reached over and patted the ancient dog, and 
he apologized, “I been around him so much I 
never notice how he stinks.” 

“Well, I can’t stand him in here,” said Carl- 
son. “That stink hangs around even after he’s 


OF MICE AND MEN 

gone. He walked over with his heavy-legged 
stride and looked down at the dog. “Got no 
teeth,” he said. “He’s all stiff with rheumatism. 
He ain’t no good to you, Candy. An’ he ain’t 
no good to himself. Why’n’t you shoot him, 
Candy?” 

The old man squirmed uncomfortably. “Well 
—hell! I had him so long. Had him since he was 
a pup. I herded sheep with him.” He said 
proudly, “You wouldn’t think it to look at him 
now, but he was the best damn sheep dog I ever 
seen.” 

George said, “I seen a guy in Weed that had 
an Airedale could herd sheep. Learned it from 
the other dogs.” 

Carlson was not to be put off. “Look, Candy. 
This of dog jus’ suffers hisself all the time. If 
you was to take him out and shoot him right in 
the back of the head—” he leaned over and 
pointed, “—right there, why he’d never know 
what hit him.” 

Candy looked about unhappily. “No,” he said 
80 



OF MICE AND MEN 

softly. “No, I couldn’ do that. I had ’im too 
long.” 

“He don’t have no fun,” Carlson insisted. 
“And he stinks to beat hell. Tell you what. I’ll 
shoot him for you. Then it won’t be you that 
does it.” 

Candy threw his legs off his bunk. He 
scratched the white stubble whiskers on his 
cheek nervously. “I’m so used to him,” he said 
softly. “I had him from a pup.” 

“Well, you ain’t bein’ kind to him keepin’ 
him alive,” said Carlson. “Look, Slim’s bitch got 
a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you one 
of them pups to raise up, wouldn’t you, Slim?” 

The skinner had been studying the old dog 
with his calm eyes. “Yeah,” he said. “You can 
have a pup if you want to.” He seemed to shake 
himself free for speech. “Carl’s right, Candy. 
That dog ain’t no good to himself. I wisht some- 
body’d shoot me if I get old an’ a cripple.” 

Candy looked helplessly at him, for Slim’s 
opinions were law. “Maybe it’d hurt him,” he 


OF MICE AND MEN 


suggested. “I don’t mind takin’ care of him.” 

Carlson said, “The way I’d shoot him, he 
wouldn’t feel nothing. I’d put the gun right 
there.” He pointed with his toe. “Right back of 
the head. He wouldn’t even quiver.” 

Candy looked for help from face to face. It 
was quite dark outside by now. A young labor- 
ing man came in. His sloping shoulders were 
bent forward and he walked heavily on his heels, 
as though he carried the invisible grain bag. He 
went to his bunk and put his hat on his shelf. 
Then he picked a pulp magazine from his shelf 
and brought it to the light over the table. “Did 
I show you this, Slim?” he asked. 

“Show me what?” 

The young man turned to the back of the 
magazine, put it down on the table and pointed 
with his finger. “Right there, read that.” Slim 
bent over it. “Go on,” said the young man. 
“Read it out loud.” 

“ ‘Dear Editor’ Slim read slowly. “ ‘I read 
your mag for six years and I think it is the best 


OF MICE AND MEN 


on the market. I like stories by Peter Rand. I 
think he is a whing-ding. Give us more like the 
Dark Rider. I don’t write many letters. Just 
thought I would tell you I think your mag is 
the best dime’s worth I ever spent.’ ” 

Slim looked up questioningly. “What you 
want me to read that for?” 

Whit said, “Go on. Read the name at the bot- 
tom.” 

Slim read, “ ‘Yours for success, William Ten- 
ner.’ ” He glanced up at Whit again. “What you 
want me to read that for?” 

Whit closed the magazine impressively. 
“Don’t you remember Bill Tenner? Worked 
here about three months ago?” 

Slim thought. . . . “Little guy?” he asked. 
“Drove a cultivator?” 

“That’s him,” Whit cried. “That’s the guy!” 

“You think he’s the guy wrote this letter?” 

“I know it. Bill and me was in here one day. 
Bill had one of them books that just come. He 
was lookin’ in it and he says, ‘I wrote a letter. 

83 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Wonder if they put it in the book!’ But it wasn’t 
there. Bill says, 'Maybe they’re savin’ it for 
later.’ An’ that’s just what they done. There 
it is.” 

“Guess you’re right,” said Slim. “Got it right 
in the book.” 

George held out his hand for the magazine. 
“Let’s look at it?” 

Whit found the place again, but he did not 
surrender his hold on it. He pointed out the let- 
ter with his forefinger. And then he went to 
his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in. 
“I wonder if Bill seen it,” he said. “Bill and me 
worked in that patch of field peas. Run cultiva- 
tors, both of us. Bill was a hell of a nice fella.” 

During the conversation Carlson had refused 
to be drawn in. He continued to look down at 
the old dog. Candy watched him uneasily. At 
last Carlson said, “If you want me to, I’ll put the 
old devil out of his misery right now and get it 
over with. Ain’t nothing left for him. Can’t eat, 
can’t see, can’t even walk without hurtin’.” 

Candy said hopefully, “You ain’t got no gun.” 

84 


r 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“The hell I ain’t. Got a Luger. It won’t hurt 
him none at all.” 

Candy said, “Maybe tomorra. Le’s wait till 
tomorra.” 

“I don’t see no reason for it,” said Carlson. 
He went to his bunk, pulled his bag from under- 
neath it and took out a Luger pistol. “Le’s get it 
over with,” he said. “We can’t sleep with him 
stinkin’ around in here.” He put the pistol in his 
hip pocket. 

Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to 
find some reversal. And Slim gave him none. At 
last Candy said softly and hopelessly, “Awright 
—take ’im.” He did not look down at the dog at 
all. He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms 
behind his head and stared at the ceiling. 

From his pocket Carlson took a little leather 
thong. He stooped over and tied it around the 
old dog’s neck. All the men except Candy 
watched him. “Come boy. Come on, boy,” he 
said gently. And he said apologetically to Candy, 
“He won’t even feel it.” Candy did not move 
nor answer him. He twitched the thong. “Come 

8 S 


OF MICE AND MEN 


on, boy.” The old dog got slowly and stiffly to 
his feet and followed the gently pulling leash. 

Slim said, “Carlson.” 

“Yeah?” 

“You know what to do.” 

“What ya mean, Slim?” 

“Take a shovel,” said Slim shortly. 

“Oh, sure! I get you.” He led the dog out into 
the darkness. 

George followed to the door and shut the 
door and set the latch gently in its place. Candy 
lay rigidly on his bed staring at the ceiling. 

Slim said loudly, “One of my lead mules got 
a bad hoof. Got to get some tar on it.” His voice 
trailed off. It was silent outside. Carlson’s foot- 
steps died away. The silence come into the 
room. And the silence lasted. 

George chuckled, “I bet Lennie’s right out 
there in the bam with his pup. He won’t want 
to come in here no more now he’s got a pup.” 

Slim said, “Candy, you can have any one of 
them pups you want.” 

86 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Candy did not answer. The silence fell on the 
room again. It came out of the night and invaded 
the room. George said, “Anybody* like to play 
a little euchre?” 

“Pll play out a few with you,” said Whit. 

They took places opposite each other at the 
table under the light, but George did not shuffle 
the cards. He rippled the edge of the deck ner- 
vously, and the little snapping noise drew the 
eyes of all the men in the room, so that he 
stopped doing it. The silence fell on the room 
again. A minute passed, and another minute. 
Candy lay still, staring at the ceiling. Slim gazed 
at him for a moment and then looked down at 
his hands; he subdued one hand with the other, 
and held it down. There came a little gnawing 
sound from under the floor and all the men 
looked down toward it gratefully. Only Candy 
continued to stare at the ceiling. 

“Sounds like there was a rat under there,” 
said George. “We ought to get a trap down 
there.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Whit broke out, “What the hell’s takin’ him 
so long? Lay out some cards, why don’t you? 
We ain’t going to get no euchre played this 
way.” 

George brought the cards together tightly and 
studied the backs of them. The silence was in 
the room again. 

A shot sounded in the distance. The men 
looked quickly at the old man. Every head 
turned toward him. 

For a moment he continued to stare at the 
ceiling. Then he rolled slowly over and faced 
the wall and lay silent. 

George shuffled the cards noisily and dealt 
them. Whit drew a scoring board to him and set 
the pegs to start. Whit said, “I guess you guys 
really come here to work.” 

“How do ya mean?” George asked. 

Whit laughed. “Well, ya come on a Friday. 
You got two days to work till Sunday.” 

“I don’t see how you figure,” said George. 
Whit laughed again. “You do if you been 
88 


OF MICE AND MEN 


around these big ranches much. Guy that wants 
to look over a ranch comes in Sat’day afternoon. 
He gets Sat’day night supper an’ three meals on 
Sunday, and he can quit Monday momin’ after 
breakfast without turning his hand. But you 
come to work Friday noon. You got to put in a 
day an’ a half no matter how you figure.” 

George looked at him levelly. “We’re gonna 
stick aroun’ a while,” he said. “Me an’ Lennie’s 
gonna roll up a stake.” 

The door opened quietly and the stable buck 
put in his head; a lean negro head, lined with 
pain, the eyes patient. “Mr. Slim.” 

Slim took his eyes from old Candy. “Huh? 
Oh! Hello, Crooks. What’s’a matter?” 

“You told me to warm up tar for that mule’s 
foot. I got it warm.” 

“Oh! Sure, Crooks. I’ll come right out an’ put 
it on.” 

“I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim.” 

“No. I’ll come do it myself.” He stood up. 

Crooks said, “Mr. Slim.” 


89 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“Yeah.” 

“That big new guy’s messin’ around your 
pups out in the bam.” 

“Weil, he ain’t doin’ no harm. I give him one 
of them pups.” 

“Just thought I’d tell ya,” said Crooks. “He’s 
takin’ ’em outa the nest and handlin’ them. That 
won’t do them no good.” 

“He won’t hurt ’em,” said Slim. “I’ll come 
along with you now.” 

George looked up. “If that crazy bastard’s 
foolin’ around too much, jus’ kick him out, 
Slim.” 

Slim followed the stable buck out of the 
room. 

George dealt and Whit picked up his cards 
and examined them. “Seen the new kid yet?” 
he asked. 

“What kid?” George asked. 

“Why, Curley’s new wife.” 

“Yeah, I seen her.” 

“Well, ain’t she a looloo?” 

9 ° 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“I ain’t seen that much of her,” said George. 

Whit laid down his cards impressively. “Well, 
stick around an’ keep your eyes open. You’ll see 
plenty. She ain’t concealin’ nothing. I never seen 
nobody like her. She got the eye goin’ all the 
time on everybody. I bet she even gives the 
stable buck the eye. I don’t know what the hell 
she wants.” 

George asked casually, “Been any trouble 
since she got here?” 

It was obvious that Whit was not interested 
in his cards. He laid his hand down and George 
scooped it in. George laid out his deliberate soli- 
taire hand— seven cards, and six on top, and five 
on top of those. 

Whit said, “I see what you mean. No, they 
ain’t been nothing yet. Curley’s got yella-jackets 
in his drawers, but that’s all so far. Ever’ time 
the guys is around she shows up. She’s lookin’ 
for Curley, or she thought she lef’ somethin’ 
layin’ around and she’s lookin’ for it. Seems like 
she can’t keep away from guys. An’ Curley’s 


OF MICE AND MEN 

pants is just crawlin’ with ants, but they ain’t 
nothing come of it yet.” 

George said, “She’s gonna make a mess. 
They’s gonna be a bad mess about her. She’s a 
jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley got 
his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch 
of guys on it ain’t no place for a girl, specially 
like her.” 

Whit said, “If you got idears, you ought ta 
come in town with us guys tomorra ni ght.” 
“Why? What’s doin’?” 

“Jus’ the usual thing. We go in to old Susy’s 
place. Hell of a nice place. Old Susy’s a laugh- 
always crackin’ jokes. Like she says when we 
come up on the front porch las’ Sat’day night. 
Susy opens the door and then she yells over her 
shoulder, ‘Get yor coats on, girls, here comes 
the sheriff.’ She never talks dirty, neither. Got 
five girls there.” 

“What’s it set you back?” George asked. 

“Two an’ a half. You can get a shot for two 
bits. Susy got nice chairs to set in, too. If a guy 
92 


OF MICE AND MEN 


don’t want a flop, why he can just set in the 
chairs and have a couple or three shots and pass 
the time of day and Susy don’t give a damn. She 
ain’t rushin’ guys through and kickin’ ’em out 
if they don’t want a flop.” 

“Might go in and look the joint over,” said 
George. 

“Sure. Come along. It’s a hell of a lot of fun— 
her crackin’ jokes all the time. Like she says one 
time, she says, ‘I’ve knew people that if they got 
a rag rug on the floor an’ a kewpie doll lamp on 
the phonograph they think they’re running a 
parlor house.’ That’s Clara’s house she’s talkin’ 
about. An’ Susy says, ‘I know what you boys 
want,’ she says. ‘My girls is clean,’ she says, ‘an’ 
there ain’t no water in my whisky,’ she says. ‘If 
any you guys wanta look at a kewpie doll lamp 
an’ take your own chance gettin’ burned, why 
you know where to go.’ An’ she says, ‘There’s 
guys around here walkin’ bow-legged ’cause 
they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp.’ ” 


OF MICE AND MEN 

George asked, “Clara runs the other house, 
huh?” 

Yeah, said Whit. “We don’t never go there. 
Clara gets three bucks a crack and thirty-five 
cents a shot, and she don’t crack no jokes. But 
Susy’s place is clean and she got nice chairs. 
Don’t let no goo-goos in, neither.” 

“Me an’ Lennie’s rollin’ up a stake,” said 
George. “I might go in an’ set and have a shot, 
but I ain’t puttin’ out no two and a half.” 

“Well, a guy got to have some fun some- 
time,” said Whit. 

The door opened and Lennie and Carlson 
came in together. Lennie crept to his bunk and 
sat down, trying not to attract attention. Carlson 
reached under his bunk and brought out his bag. 
He didn’t look at old Candy, who still faced the 
wall. Carlson found a little cleaning rod in the 
bag and a can of oil. He laid them on his bed 
and then brought out the pistol, took out the 
magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the 
chamber. Then he fell to cleaning the barrel 

94 


OF MICE AND MEN 


with the little rod. When the ejector snapped, 

Candy turned over and looked for a moment at 
the gun before he turned back to the wall again. 

Carlson said casually, “Curley been in yet?” 

“No,” said Whit. “What’s eatin’ on Curley?” 

Orison squinted down the barrel of his gun. 

“Lookin’ for his old lady. I seen him going 
round and round outside.” 

Whit said sarcastically, “He spends half his 
time lookin’ for her, and the rest of the time fc 

she’s lookin’ for him.” 

Curley burst into the room excitedly. “Any 
you guys seen my wife?” he demanded. j 

“She ain’t been here,” said Whit. 

Curley looked threateningly about the room. 

“Where the hell’s Slim?” 

“Went out in the barn,” said George. “He 
was gonna put some tar on a split hoof.” 

Curley’s shoulders dropped and squared. 

“How long ago’d he go?” 

“Five— ten minutes.” 

Curley jumped out the door and banged it 
after him. I 


95 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Whit stood up. “I guess maybe I’d like to see 
this,” he said. “Curley’s just spoilin’ or he 
wouldn’t start for Slim. An’ Curley’s handy, God 
damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden 
Gloves. He got newspaper clippings about it.” 
He considered. “But jus’ the same, he better 
leave Slim alone. Nobody don’t know what 
Slim can do.” 

“Thinks Slim’s with his wife, don’t he?” said 
George. 

“Looks like it,” Whit said. “ ’Course Slim 
ain’t. Least I don’t think Slim is. But I like to see 
the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le’s go.” 

George said, “I’m stayin’ right here. I don’t 
want to get mixed up in nothing. Lennie and 
me got to make a stake.” 

Carlson finished the cleaning of the gun and 
put it in the bag and pushed the bag under his 
bunk. “I guess I’ll go out and look her over,” 
he said. Old Candy lay still, and Lennie, from 
his bunk, watched George cautiously. 

When Whit and Carlson were gone and the 
96 


OF MICE AND MEN 


door closed after them, George turned to Len- 
nie. “What you got on your mind?” 

“I ain’t done nothing, George. Slim says I 
better not pet them pups so much for a while. 
Slim says it ain’t good for them; so I come right 
in. I been good, George.” 

“I coulda told you that,” said George. 

“Well, I wasn’t hurtin’ ’em none. I jus’ had 
mine in my lap pettin’ it.” 

George asked, “Did you see Slim out in the 
bam?” 

“Sure I did. He tol’ me I better not pet that 
pup no more.” 

“Did you see that girl?” 

“You mean Curley’s girl?” 

“Yeah. Did she come in the bam?” 

“No. Anyways I never seen her.” 

“You never seen Slim talkin’ to her?” 

“Uh-uh. She ain’t been in the bam.” 

“O.K.,” said George. “I guess them guys ain’t 
gonna see no fight. If there’s any fightin’, Len- 
nie, you keep out of it.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“I don’t want no fights,” said Lennie. He got 
up from his bunk and sat down at the table, 
across from George. Almost automatically 
George shuffled the cards and laid out his soli- 
taire hand. He used a deliberate, thoughtful, 
slowness. 

Lennie reached for a face card and studied 
it, then turned it upside down and studied it. 
“Both ends the same,” he said. “George, why 
is it both end’s the same?” 

“I don’t know,” said George. “That’s jus’ the 
way they make ’em. What was Slim doin’ in the 
bam when you seen him?” 

“Slim?” 

“Sure. You seen him in the bam, an’ he tol’ 
you not to pet the pups so much.” 

“Oh, yeah. He had a can a’ tar an’ a paint 
brash. I don’t know what for.” 

“You sure that girl didn’t come in like she 
come in here today?” 

“No. She never come.” 

George sighed. “You give me a good whore 
98 


OF MICE AND MEN 


house every time,” he said. “A guy can go in 
an’ get drunk and get ever’thing outa his system 
all at once, an’ no messes. And he knows how 
much it’s gonna set him back. These here jail 
baits is just set on the trigger of the hoosegow.” 

Lennie followed his words admiringly, and 
moved his lips a little to keep up. George con- 
tinued, “You remember Andy Cushman, Len- 
nie? Went to grammar school?” 

“The one that his old lady used to make hot 
cakes for the kids?” Lennie asked. 

“Yeah. That’s the one. You can remember 
anything if there’s anything to eat in it.” George 
looked carefully at the solitaire hand. He put an 
ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three 
and four of diamonds on it. “Andy’s in San 
Quentin right now on account of a tart,” said 
George. 

Lennie drummed on the table with his fingers. 
“George?” 

“Huh?” 

“George, how long’s it gonna be till we get 

99 


OF MICE AND MEN 


that little place an’ live on the fatta the lan— an’ 
rabbits?” 

“I don’ know,” said George. “We gotta get 
a big stake together. I know a little place we 
can get cheap, but they ain’t givin’ it away.” 

Old Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were 
wide open. He watched George carefully. 

Lennie said, “Tell about that place, George.” 

“I jus’ tol’ you, jus’ las’ night.” 

“Go on— tell again, George.” 

“Well, it’s ten acres,” said George. “Got a 
little win’mill. Got a little shack on it, an’ a 
chicken run. Got a kitchen, orchard, cherries, 
apples, peaches, ’cots, nuts, got a few berries. 
They’s a place for alfalfa and plenty water to 
flood it. They’s a pig pen — ” 

“An’ rabbits, George.” 

“No place for rabbits now, but I could easy 
build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa 
to the rabbits.” 

“Damn right, I could,” said Lennie. “You 
God damn right I could.” 


ioo 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George’s hands stopped working with the 
cards. His voice was growing warmer. “An’ we 
could have a few pigs. I could build a smoke 
house like the one gran’pa had, an’ when we kill 
a pig we can smoke the bacon and the hams, 
and make sausage an’ all like that. An’ when the 
salmon run up river we could catch a hundred 
of ’em an’ salt ’em down or smoke ’em. We 
could have them for breakfast. They ain’t noth- 
ing so nice as smoked salmon. When the fruit 
come in we could can it— and tomatoes, they’re 
easy to can. Ever’ Sunday we’d kill a chicken 
or a rabbit. Maybe we’d have a cow or a goat, 
and the cream is so God damn thick you got to 
cut it with a knife and take it out with a spoon.” 

Lennie watched him with wide eyes, and old 
Candy watched him too. Lennie said softly, 
“We could live offa the fatta the lan’.” 

“Sure,” said George. “All kin’s a vegetables 
in the garden, and if we want a little whisky 
we can sell a few eggs or something, or some 
milk. We’d jus’ live there. We’d belong there. 




I

There wouldn’t be no more runnin’ round the 
country and gettin’ fed by a Jap cook. No, sir, 
we’d have our own place where we belonged 
and not sleep in no bunk house.” 

“Tell about the house, George,” Lennie 
begged. 

“Sure, we’d have a little house an’ a room to 
ourself. Little fat iron stove, an’ in the winter 
we’d keep a fire goin’ in it. It ain’t enough land 
so we’d have to work too hard. Maybe six, seven 
hours a day. We wouldn’t have to buck no bar- 
ley eleven hours a day. An’ when we put in a 
crop, why, we’d be there to take the crop up. 
We’d know what come of our planting.” 

“An’ rabbits,” Lennie said eagerly. “An’ I’d 
take care of ’em. Tell how I’d do that, George.” 

“Sure, you’d go out in the alfalfa patch an’ 
you’d have a sack. You’d fill up the sack and 
bring it in an’ put it in the rabbit cages.” 

“They’d nibble an’ they’d nibble,” said Len- 
nie, “the way they do. I seen ’em.” 

“Ever’ six weeks or so,” George continued, 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“them does would throw a litter so we’d have 
plenty rabbits to eat an’ to sell. An’ we’d keep 
a few pigeons to go flyin’ around the win’mill 
like they done when I was a kid.” He looked 
rapdy at the wall over Lennie’s head. “An’ it’d 
be our own, an’ nobody could can us. If we 
don’t like a guy we can say, ‘Get the hell out/ 
and by God he’s got to do it. An’ if a fren’ come 
along, why we’d have an extra bunk, an’ we’d 
say, ‘Why don’t you spen’ the night?’ an’ by 
God he would. We’d have a setter dog and a 
couple stripe cats, but you gotta watch out 
them cats don’t get the little rabbits.” 

Lennie breathed hard. “You jus’ let ’em try to 
get the rabbits. I’ll break their God damn necks. 
I’ll .... I’ll smash ’em with a stick.” He sub- 
sided, grumbling to himself, threatening the 
future cats which might dare to disturb the 
future rabbits. 

George sat entranced with his own picture. 

When Candy spoke they both jumped as 

i°3 


OF MICE AND MEN 

though they had been caught doing some thing 
reprehensible. Candy said, “You know where’s 
a place like that?” 

George was on guard immediately. “S’pose I 
do,” he said. “What’s that to you?” 

“You don’t need to tell me where it’s at. 
Might be any place.” 

“Sure,” said George. “That’s right. You 
couldn’t find it in a hundred years.” 

Candy went on excitedly, “How much they 
want for a place like that?” 

George watched him suspiciously. “Well-I 
could get it for six hundred bucks. The oI’ peo- 
ple that owns it is flat bust an’ the ol’ lady needs 
an operation. Say— what’s it to you? You got 
nothing to do with us.” 

Candy said, “I ain’t much good with on’y one 
hand. I lost my hand right here on this ranch. 
Thats why they give me a job swampin’. An’ 
they give me two hunderd an’ fifty dollars 
cause I los’ my hand. An’ I got fifty more saved 
up right in the bank, right now. Tha’s three 
104 


OF MICE AND MEN 


hunderd, and I got fifty more cornin’ the end 
a the month. Tell yon what — ” He leaned for- 
ward eagerly. “S’pose I went in with you guys. 
Tha’s three hunderd an’ fifty bucks I’d put in. 
I ain’t much good, but I could cook and tend 
the chickens and hoe the garden some. How’d 
that be?” 

George half-closed his eyes. “I gotta think 
about that. We was always gonna do it by our- 
selves.” 

Candy interrupted him, “I’d make a will an’ 
leave my share to you guys in case I kick off, 
’cause I ain’t got no relatives nor nothing. You 
guys got any money? Maybe we could do her 
right now?” 

George spat on the floor disgustedly. “We 
got ten bucks between us.” Then he said 
thoughtfully, “Look, if me an’ Lennie work a 
month an’ don’t spen’ nothing, we’ll have a hun- 
derd bucks. That’d be four fifty. I bet we could 
swing her for that. Then you an’ Lennie could 
go get her started an’ I’d get a job an’ make up 

i°5 


OF MICE AND MEN 

the res’, an’ you could sell eggs an’ stuff like 
that.” 

They fell into a silence. They looked at one 
another, amazed. This thing they had never 
really believed in was coming true. George said 
reverently, “Jesus Christ! I bet we could swing 
her.” His eyes were full of wonder. “I bet we 
could swing her,” he repeated softly. 

Candy sat on the edge of his bunk. He 
scratched the stump of his wrist nervously. “I 
got hurt four year ago,” he said. “They’ll can 
me purty soon. Jus’ as soon as I can’t swamp out 
no bunk houses they’ll put me on the county. 
Maybe if I give you guys my money, you’ll let 
me hoe in the garden even after I ain’t no good 
at it. An 1 11 wash dishes an’ little chicken stuff 
like that. But I’ll be on our own place, an’ I’ll be 
let to work on our own place.” He said miser- 
ably, You seen what they done to my dog to- 
night? They says he wasn’t no good to himself 
nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht 
somebody’d shoot me. But they won’t do noth- 
106 


OF MICE AND MEN 


ing like that. I won’t have no place to go, an’ I 
can’t get no more jobs. I’ll have thirty dollars 
more cornin’, time you guys is ready to quit.” 

George stood up. “We’ll do her,” he said. 
“We’ll fix up that little old place an’ we’ll go 
live there.” He sat down again. They all sat still, 
all bemused by the beauty of the thing, each 
mind was popped into the future when this 
lovely thing should come about. 

George said wonderingly, “S’pose they was a 
carnival or a circus come to town, or a ball 
game, or any damn thing.” Old Candy nodded 
in appreciation of the idea. “We’d just go to 
her,” George said. “We wouldn’t ask nobody if 
we could. Jus’ say, We’ll go to her,’ an’ we 
would. Jus’ milk the cow and sling some grain 
to the chickens an’ go to her.” 

“An’ put some grass to the rabbits,” Lennie 
broke in. “I wouldn’t never forget to feed them. 
When we gon’ta do it, George?” 

“In one month. Right squack in one month. 
Know what I’m gon’ta do? I’m gon’ta write to 

107 


OF MICE AND MEN 

them old people that owns the place that we’ll 

take it. An’ Candy’ll send a hunderd dollars to 
bind her.” 

“Sure will,” said Candy. “They got a good 
stove there?” 

“Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood.” 
“I’m gonna take my pup,” said Lennie. “I bet 
by Christ he likes it there, by Jesus.” 

Voices were approaching from outside. 
George said quickly, “Don’t tell nobody about 
it. Jus’ us three an’ nobody else. They li’ble to 
can us so we can’t make no stake. Jus’ go on 
like we was gonna buck barley the rest of our 
lives, then all of a sudden some day we’ll go get 
our pay an’ scram outa here.” 

Lennie and Candy nodded, and they were 
grinning with delight. “Don’t tell nobody,” 
Lennie said to himself. 

Candy said, “George.” 

“Huh?” 

“I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. 

I shouldn’t ought to of let no stranger shoot 
my dog.”

The door opened. Slim came in, followed by 
Curley and Carlson and Whit. Slim’s hands were 
black with tar and he was scowling. Curley 
hung close to his elbow. 

Curley said, “Well, I didn’t mean nothing. 
Slim. I just ast you.” 

Slim said, “Well, you been askin’ me too 
often. I’m gettin’ God damn sick of it. If you 
can’t look after your own God damn wife, what 
you expect me to do about it? You lay offa 
me.” 

“I’m jus’ tryin’ to tell you I didn’t mean noth- 
ing,” said Curley. “I jus’ thought you might of 
saw her.” 

“Why’n’t you tell her to stay the hell home 
where she belongs?” said Carlson. “You let her 
hang around bunk houses and pretty soon you’re 
gonna have som’pin on your hands and you 
won’t be able to do nothing about it.” 

Curley whirled on Carlson. “You keep outta 
this les’ you wanta step outside.” 

Carlson laughed. “You God damn punk,” he 

109 


OF MICE AND MEN 

said. “You tried to throw a scare into S lim, an’ 
you couldn’t make it stick. Slim throwed a scare 
inta you. You’re yella as a frog belly. I don’t 
care if you’re the best welter in the country. 
You come for me, an’ I’ll kick your God damn 
head off.” 

Candy joined the attack with joy. “Glove 
fulla vaseline,” he said disgustedly. Curley 
glared at him. His eyes slipped on past and 
lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling 
with delight at the memory of the ranch. 

Curley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. 
‘‘What the hell you laughin’ at?” 

Lennie looked blankly at him . “Huh?” 

Then Curley’s rage exploded. “Come on, ya 
big bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son-of- 
a-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I’ll show ya who’s 
yella.” 

Lennie looked helplessly at George, and then 
he got up and tried to retreat. Curley was bal- 
anced and poised. He slashed at Lennie with his 
left, and then smashed down his nose with a 


no 



OF MICE AND MEN 

right. Lennie gave a cry of terror. Blood welled 
from his nose. “George,” he cried. “Make ’urn 
let me alone, George.” He backed until he was 
against the wall, and Curley followed, slugging 
him in the face. Lennie’s hands remained at his 
sides; he was too frightened to defend himself. 

George was on his feet yelling, “Get him, 
Lennie. Don’t let him do it.” 

Lennie covered his face with his huge paws 
and bleated with terror. He cried, “Make ’um 
stop, George.” Then Curley attacked his stom- 
ach and cut off his wind. 

Slim jumped up. “The dirty little rat,” he 
cried, “I’ll get ’um myself.” 

George put out his hand and grabbed Slim. 
“Wait a minute,” he shouted. He cupped his 
hands around his mouth and yelled, “Get ’im, 
Lennie!” 

Lennie took his hands away from his face and 
looked about for George, and Curley slashed at 
his eyes. The big face was covered with blood. 
George yelled again, “I said get him .” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Curley’s fist was swinging when Lennie 
reached for it. The next minute Curley was 
flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist 
was lost in Lennie’s big hand. George ran down 
the room. “Leggo of him, Lennie. Let go.” 

But Lennie watched in terror the flopping 
little man whom he held. Blood ran down Len- 
nie’s face, one of his eyes was cut and closed. 
George slapped him in the face again and again, 
and still Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley 
was white and shrunken by now, and his strug- 
gling had become weak. He stood crying, his 
fist lost in Lennie’s paw. 

George shouted over and over, “Leggo his 
hand, Lennie. Leggo. Slim, come help me while 
the guy got any hand left.” 

Suddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouched 
cowering against the wall. “You tol’ me to, 
George,” he said miserably. 

Curley sat down on the floor, looking in won- 
der at his crushed hand. Slim and Carlson bent 
over him. Then Slim straightened up and re- 


112 


OF MICE AND MEN 


garded Lennie with horror. “We got to get him 
in to a doctor,” he said. “Looks to me like ever’ 
bone in his han’ is bust.” 

“I didn’t wanta,” Lennie cried. “I didn’t 
wanta hurt him.” 

Slim said, “Carlson, you get the candy wagon 
hitched up. We’ll take ’um into Soledad an’ get 
’um fixed up.” Carlson hurried out. Slim turned 
to the whimpering Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” 
he said. “This punk sure had it cornin’ to him. 
But— Jesus! He ain’t hardly got no han’ left.” 
Slim hurried out, and in a moment returned 
with a tin cup of water. Fie held it to Curley’s 
lips. 

George said, “Slim, will we get canned now? 
We need the stake. Will Curley’s old man can 
us now?” 

Slim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside 
Curley. “You got your senses in hand enough 
to listen?” he asked. Curley nodded. “Well, 
then listen,” Slim went on. “I think you got 
your han’ caught in a machine. If you don’t 

H3 


OF MICE AND MEN 

tell nobody what happened, we ain’t going to. 
But you jus’ tell an’ try to get this guy canned 
and we’ll tell ever’body, an’ then will you get 
the laugh.” 

“I won’t tell,” said Curley. He avoided look- 
ing at Lennie. 

Buggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped 
Curley up. “Come on now. Carlson’s gonna take 
you to a doctor.” He helped Curley out the 
door. The sound of wheels drew away. In a 
moment Slim came back into the bunk house. 
He looked at Lennie, still crouched fearfully 
against the wall. “Le’s see your hands,” he asked. 

Lennie stuck out his hands. 

“Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at 
me,” Slim said. 

George broke in, “Lennie was jus’ scairt,” he 
explained. “He didn’t know what to do. I told 
you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I 
guess it was Candy I told.” 

Candy nodded solemnly. “That’s jus’ what 
you done,” he said. “Right this morning when 
1 14 


OF MICE AND MEN 



Curley first lit intil your fren\ you says, ‘He 
better not fool with Lennie if he knows what’s 
good for ’um.’ That’s jus’ what you says to me.” 

George turned to Lennie. “It ain’t your fault,” 
he said. “You don’t need to be scairt no more. 
You done jus’ what I tol’ you to. Maybe you 
better go in the wash room an’ clean up your 
face. You look like hell.” 

Lennie smiled with his bruised mouth. “I 
didn’t want no trouble,” he said. He walked 
toward the door, but just before he came to it, 
he turned back. “George?” 

“What you want?” 

“I can still tend the rabbits, George?” 

“Sure. You ain’t done nothing wrong.” 

“I di’n’t mean no harm, George.” 

“Well, get the hell out and wash your face.” 


CROOKS, the negro stable buck, had his bunk 
in the harness room; a little shed that leaned off 
the wall of the bam. On one side of the little 
room there was a square four-paned window, 
and on the other, a narrow plank door leading 
into the barn. Crooks’ bunk was a long box 
filled with straw, on which his blankets were 
flung. On the wall by the window there were 
pegs on which hung broken harness in process 
of being mended;^ strips of new leather; and 
under the window itself a little bench for 
leather-working tools, curved knives and needles 
and balls of linen thread, and a small hand riv- 
eter. On pegs were also pieces of harness, a split 
collar with the horsehair stuffing sticking out, a 
broken hame, and a trace chain with its leather 
ix6 


OF MICE AND MEN 


covering split. Crooks had his apple box over his 
bunk, and in it a range of medicine bottles, both 
for himself and for the horses. There were cans 
of saddle soap and a drippy can of tar with its 
paint brush sticking over the edge. And scat- 
tered about the floor were a number of personal 
possessions; for, being alone, Crooks could leave 
his things about, and being a stable buck and a 
cripple, he was more permanent than the other 
men, and he had accumulated more possessions 
than he could carry on his back. 

Crooks possessed several pairs of shoes, a pair 
of rubber boots, a big alarm clock and a single- 
barreled shotgun. And he had books, too; a tat- 
tered dictionary and a mauled copy of the Cali- 
fornia civil code for 1905. There were battered 
magazines and a few dirty books on a special 
shelf over his bunk. A pair of large gold-rimmed 
spectacles hung from a nail on the wall above 
his bed. 

This room was swept and fairly neat, for 
Crooks was a proud, aloof man. He kept his dis- 

117 


OF MICE AND MEN 

tance and demanded that other people keep 
theirs. His body was bent over to the left by 
his crooked spine, and his eyes lay deep in his 
head, and because of their depth seemed to glit- 
ter with intensity. His lean face was lined with 
deep black wrinkles, and he had thin, pain-tight- 
ened lips which were lighter than his face. 

It was Saturday night. Through the open door 
that led into the bam came the sound of moving 
horses, of feet stirring, of teeth champing on 
hay, of the rattle of halter chains. In the stable 
bucks room a small electric globe threw a 
meager yellow light. 

Crooks sat on his bunk. His shirt was out of 
his jeans in back. In one hand he held a bottle 
of liniment, and with the other he rubbed his 
spme. Now and then he poured a few drops of 
the liniment into his pink-palmed hand and 
reached up under his shirt to rub again. He 
flexed his muscles against his back and shivered. 

Noiselessly Lennie appeared in the open door- 
way and stood there looking in, his big shoulders 
118 


OF MICE AND MEN 


nearly filling the opening. For a moment Crooks 
did not see him, but on raising his eyes he 
stiffened and a scowl came on his face. His hand 
came out from under his shirt. 

Lennie smiled helplessly in an attempt to make 
friends. 

Crooks said sharply, “You got no right to 
come in my room. This here’s my room. 
Nobody got any right in here but me.” 

Lennie gulped and his smile grew more fawn- 
ing. “I ain’t doing nothing,” he said. “Just come 
to look at my puppy. And I seen your light,” he 
explained. 

“Well, I got a right to have a light. You go 
on get outta my room. I ain’t wanted in the 
bunk house, and you ain’t wanted in my room.” 

“Why ain’t you wanted?” Lennie asked. 

“ ’Cause I’m black. They play cards in there, 
but I can’t play because I’m black. They say I 
stink. Well, I tell you, you all of you stink 
to me.” 

Lennie flapped his big hands helplessly. 

”9 


OF MICE AND MEN 

“Ever’body went into town,” he said. “Slim 
an’ George an’ ever’body. George says I gotta 

stay here an’ not get in no trouble. I seen your 
light.” 

“Well, what do you want?” 

“Nothing— I seen your light. I thought I could 
jus’ come in an’ set.” 

Crooks stared at Lennie, and he reached be- 
hind him and took down the spectacles and 
adjusted them over his pink ears and stared 
again. “I don’t know what you’re doin’ in the 
bam anyway,” he complained. “You ain’t no 
skinner. They’s no call for a bucker to come 
into the barn at all. You ain’t no skinner. You 
ain’t got nothing to do with the horses.” 

“The pup,” Lennie repeated. “I come to see 
my pup.” 

“Well, go see your pup, then. Don’t come in 
a place where you’re not wanted.” 

Lennie lost his smile. He advanced a step into 

the room, then remembered and backed to the 
120 



OF MICE AND MEN 

door again. “I looked at ’em a little. Slim says I 
ain’t to pet ’em very much.” 

Crooks said, “Well, you been takin’ ’em out 
of the nest all the time. I wonder the old lady 
don’t move ’em someplace else.” 

“Oh, she don’t care. She lets me.” Lennie had 
moved into the room again. 

Crooks scowled, but Lennie’s disarming smile 
defeated him. “Come on in and set a while,” 
Crooks said. “ ’Long as you won’t get out and 
leave me alone, you might as well set down.” 
His tone was a little more friendly. “All the 
boys gone into town, huh?” 

“All but old Candy. He just sets in the bunk 
house sharpening his pencil and sharpening and 
figuring.” 

Crooks adjusted his glasses. “Figuring? What’s 
Candy figuring about?” 

Lennie almost shouted, “ ’Bout the rabbits.” 

“You’re nuts,” said Crooks. “You’re crazy as 
a wedge. What rabbits you talkin’ about?” 

“The rabbits we’re gonna get, and I get to 




OF MICE AND MEN 


tend ’em, cut grass an’ give ’em water, an’ like 
that.” 

“Jus’ nuts,” said Crooks. “I don’t blame the 
guy you travel with for keepin’ you outa sight.” 

Lennie said quietly, “It ain’t no lie. We’re 
gonna do it. Gonna get a little place an’ live on 
the fatta the lan’.” 

Crooks settled himself more comfortably on 
his bunk. “Set down,” he invited. “Set down on 
the nail keg.” 

Lennie hunched down on the little barrel. 
“You think it’s a lie,” Lennie said, “But it ain’t 
no lie. Ever’ word’s the truth, an’ you can ast 
George.” 

Crooks put his dark chin into his p ink palm. 
You travel aroun with George, don’t ya?” 
“Sure. Me an’ him goes ever’ place together.” 
Crooks continued. “Sometimes he talks, and 
you don’t know what the hell he’s talkin’ about. 
Ain t that so?” He leaned forward, boring Len- 
nie with his deep eyes. “Ain’t that so?” 

Yeah .... sometimes.” 


122 



OF MICE AND MEN 

“Jus’ talks on, an’ you don’t know what the 
hell it’s all about?” 

“Yeah .... sometimes. But .... not 
always.” 

Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the 
bunk. “I ain’t a southern negro,” he said. “I was 
bom right here in California. My old man had 
a chicken ranch, ’bout ten acres. The white kids 
come to play at our place, an’ sometimes I went 
to play with them, and some of them was pretty 
nice. My ol’ man didn’t like that. I never knew 
till long later why he didn’t like that. But I 
know now.” He hesitated, and when he spoke 
again his voice was softer. “There wasn’t an- 
other colored family for miles around. And now 
there ain’t a colored man on this ranch an’ 
there’s jus’ one family in Soledad.” He laughed. 
“If I say something, why it’s just a nigger say- 
in’ it.” 

Lennie asked, “How long you think it’ll be 
before them pups will be old enough to pet?” 

Crooks laughed again. “A guy can talk to you 

123 


OF MICE AND MEN 

an’ be sure you won't go blabbin’. Couple of 
weeks an’ them pups’ll be all right. George 
knows what he’s about. Jus’ talks, an’ you don’t 
understand nothing.” He leaned forward ex- 
citedly. “This is just a nigger talkin’, an’ a 
busted-back nigger. So it don’t mean nothing, 
see? You couldn’t remember it anyways. I seen 
it over an’ over-a guy talkin’ to another guy 
and it don’t make no difference if he don’t hear 
or understand. The thing is, they’re talkin’, or 
they’re settin’ still not talkin’. It don’t make no 
difference, no difference.” His excitement had 
increased until he pounded his knee with this 
hand. “George can tell you screwy things, and it 
don’t matter. It’s just the talking. It’s just bein’ 
with another guy. That’s all.” He paused. 

His voice grew soft and persuasive. “S’pose 
George don’t come back no more. S’pose he 
took a powder and just ain’t coming back. 
What’ll you do then?” 

Lenme’s attention came gradually to what had 
been said. “What?” he demanded. 

124 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“I said s’pose George went into town tonight 
and you never heard of him no more.” Crooks 
pressed forward some kind of private victory. 
“Just s’pose that,” he repeated. 

“He won’t do it,” Lennie cried. “George 
wouldn’t do nothing like that. I been with 
George a long time. He’ll come back to- 
night — ” But the doubt was too much for him. 
“Don’t you think he will?” 

Crooks’ face lighted with pleasure in his tor- 
ture. “Nobody can’t tell what a guy’ll do,” he 
observed calmly. “Le’s say he wants to come 
back and can’t. S’pose he gets killed or hurt so 
he can’t come back.” 

Lennie struggled to understand. “George 
won’t do nothing like that,” he repeated. 
“George is careful. He won’t get hurt. He ain’t 
never been hurt, ’cause he’s careful.” 

“Well, s’pose, jus’ s’pose he don’t come back. 
What’ll you do then?” 

Lennie’s face wrinkled with apprehension. “I 
don’ know. Say, what you doin’ anyways?” he 

125 


OF MICE AND MEN 


cried. “This ain’t true. George ain’t got hurt.” 

Crooks bored in on him. “Want me ta tell ya 
what’ll happen? They’ll take ya to the booby 
hatch. They’ll tie ya up with a collar, like a 
dog.” 

Suddenly Lennie’s eyes centered and grew 
quiet, and mad. He stood up and walked danger- 
ously toward Crooks. “Who hurt George?” he 
demanded. 

Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. 
He edged back on his bunk to get out of the 
way. “I was just supposin’,” he said. “George 
ain’t hurt. He’s all right. He’ll be back all 
right.” 

Lennie stood over him. “What you supposin’ 
for? Ain’t nobody goin’ to suppose no hurt to 
George.” 

Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes 
with his fingers. “Jus’ set down,” he said. 
“George ain’t hurt.” 

Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail 
i i6 . 


OF MICE AND MEN 


keg. “Ain’t nobody goin’ to talk no hurt to 
George,” he grumbled. 

Crooks said gently, “Maybe you can see now. 

You got George. You know he’s goin’ to come 

back. S’pose you didn’t have nobody. S’pose you 

couldn’t go into the bunk house and play 

rummy ’cause you was black. How’d you like j 

that? S’pose you had to sit out here an’ read j 

books. Sure you could play horseshoes till it got 

dark, but then you got to read books. Books j 

ain’t no good. A guy needs somebody— to be 

near him.” He whined, “A guy goes nuts if he j 

ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who j 

the guy is, long’s he’s with you. I tell ya,” he J 

cried, “I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets | 

sick.” j 

: . j 

“George gonna come back,” Lennie reassured 
himself in a frightened voice. “Maybe George j 

come back already. Maybe I better go see.” 

Crooks said, “I didn’t mean to scare you. j 

He’ll come back. I was talkin’ about myself. A 

127 


OF MICE AND MEN 

guy sets alone out here at night, maybe readin’ 
books or thinkin’ or stuff like that. Sometimes 
he gets thinkin’, an’ he got nothing to tell him 
what’s so an’ what ain’t so. Maybe if he sees 
somethin’, he don’t know whether it’s right or 
not. He can t turn to some other guy and ast 
him if he sees it too. He can’t tell. He got noth- 
ing to measure by. I seen things out here. I 
wasn’t drunk. I don’t know if I was asleep. If 
some guy was with me, he could tell me I was 
asleep, an’ then it would be all right. But I jus’ 
don’t know.” Crooks was looking across the 
room now, looking toward the window. 

Lennie said miserably, “George wun’t go 

away and leave me. I know George wun’t do 
that.” 

The stable buck went on dreamily, “I re- 
member when I was a little kid on my old man’s 
chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They was al- 
ways near me, always there. Used to sleep right 
in the same room, right in the same bed-all 
three. Had a strawberry patch. Had an alfalfa 
128 


OF MICE AND MEN 


patch. Used to turn the chickens out in the 
alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers’d set 
on a fence rail an’ watch ’em— white chickens 
they was.” 

Gradually Lennie’s interest came around to 
what was being said. “George says we’re gonna 
have alfalfa for the rabbits.” 

“What rabbits?” 

“We’re gonna have rabbits an’ a berry 
patch.” 

“You’re nuts.” 

“We are too. You ast George.” 

“You’re nuts.” Crooks was scornful. “I seen 
hunderds of men come by on the road an’ on 
the ranches, with their bindles on their back an’ 
that same damn thing in their heads. Hunderds 
of them. They come, an’ they quit an’ go on; 
an’ every damn one of ’em’s got a little piece of 
land in his head. An’ never a God damn one of 
’em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body 
wants a little piece of lan’. I read plenty of 
books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, 

129 


OF MICE AND MEN 


and nobody gets no land. It’s just in their head. 
They’re all the time talkin’ about it, but it’s jus’ 
in their head. He paused and looked toward the 
open door, for the horses were moving restlessly 
and the halter chains clinked. A horse whinnied. 
“I guess somebody’s out there,” Crooks said. 
“Maybe Slim. Slim comes in sometimes two, 
three times a night. Slim’s a real skinner. He 
looks out for his team.” He pulled himself pain- 
fully upright and moved toward the door. “That 
you, Slim?” he called. 

Candy’s voice answered. “Slim went in town. 
Say, you seen Lennie?” 

“Ya mean the big guy?” 

“Yeah. Seen him around any place?” 

“He’s in here,” Crooks said shortly. He went 
back to his bunk and lay down. 

Candy stood in the doorway scratching his 
bald wrist and looking blindly into the lighted 
room. He made no attempt to enter. “Tell ya 
what, Lennie. I been figuring out about them 
rabbits.” 

130 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Crooks said irritably, “You can come in if you 
want.” 

Candy seemed embarrassed. “I do’ know. 
’Course, if ya want me to.” 

“Come on in. If ever’body’s cornin’ in, you 
might just as well.” It was difficult for Crooks 
to conceal his pleasure with anger. 

Candy came in, but he was still embarrassed. 
“You got a nice cozy little place in here,” he 
said to Crooks. “Must be nice to have a room all 
to yourself this way.” 

“Sure,” said Crooks. “And a manure pile 
under the window. Sure, it’s swell.” 

Lennie broke in, “You said about them rab- 
bits.” 

Candy leaned against the wall beside the 
broken collar while he scratched the wrist 
stump. “I been here a long time,” he said. “An’ 
Crooks been here a long time. This’s the first 
time I ever been in his room.” 

Crooks said darkly, “Guys don’t come into a 
colored man’s room very much. Nobody been 
here but Slim. Slim an’ the boss.” 

131 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Candy quickly changed the subject. “Slim’s 
as good a skinner as I ever seen.” 

Lennie leaned toward the old swamper. 
“About them rabbits,” he insisted. 

Candy smiled. “I got it figured out. We can 
make some money on them rabbits if we go 
about it right.” 

“But I get to tend ’em,” Lennie broke in. 
“George says I get to tend ’em. He promised.” 

Crooks interrupted brutally. “You guys is just 
kiddin’ yourself. You’ll talk about it a hell of a 
lot, but you won’t get no land. You’ll be a 
swamper here till they take you out in a box. 
Hell, I seen too many guys. Lennie here’ll quit 
an’ be on the road in two, three weeks. Seems 
like ever’ guy got land in his head.” 

Candy rubbed his cheek angrily. “You God 
damn right we’re gonna do it. George says we 
are. We got the money right now.” 

“Yeah?” said Crooks. “An’ where’s George 
now? In town in a whore house. That’s where 
your money’s goin’. Jesus, I seen it happen too 

132 


OF MICE AND MEN 


many times. I seen too many guys with land in 
their head. They never get none under their 
hand.” 

Candy cried, “Sure they all want it. Every- 
body wants a little bit of land, not much. Jus’ 
som’thin’ that was his. Som’thin’ he could live 
on and there couldn’t nobody throw him off of 
it. I never had none. I planted crops for damn 
near ever’body in this state, but they wasn’t my 
crops, and when I harvested ’em, it wasn’t none 
of my harvest. But we gonna do it now, and 
don’t you make no mistake about that. George 
ain’t got the money in town. That money’s in 
the bank. Me an’ Lennie an’ George. We gonna 
have a room to ourself. We’re gonna have a 
dog an’ rabbits an’ chickens. We’re gonna have 
green com an’ maybe a cow or a goat.” He 
stopped, overwhelmed with his picture. 

Crooks asked, “You say you got the money?” 

“Damn right. We got most of it. Just a little 
bit more to get. Have it all in one month. 
George got the land all picked out, too.” 

*33 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Crooks reached around and explored his spine 
with his hand. “I never, seen a guy really do it,” 
he said. “I seen guys nearly crazy with loneli- 
ness for land, but ever’ time a whore house or a 
blackjack game took what it takes.” He hesi- 
tated. “ .... If you .... guys would want a 
hand to work for nothing— just his keep, why 
I’d come an’ lend a hand. I ain’t so crippled I 
can’t work like a son-of-a-bitch if I want to.” 

“Any you boys seen Curley?” 

They swung their heads toward the door. 
Looking in was Curley’s wife. Her face was 
heavily made up. Her lips were slightly parted. 
She breathed strongly, as though she had been 
running. 

“Curley ain’t been here,” Candy said sourly. 

She stood still in the doorway, smiling a little 
at them, rubbing the nails of one hand with the 
thumb and forefinger of the other. And her eyes 
traveled from one face to another. “They left 
all the weak ones here,” she said finally. “T hink 
134 


OF MICE AND MEN 

I don’t know where they all went? Even Curley. 
I know where they all went.” 

Lennie watched her, fascinated; but Candy 
and Crooks were scowling down away from her 
eyes. Candy said, “Then if you know, why you 
want to ast us where Curley is at?” 

She regarded them amusedly. “Funny thing,” 
she said. “If I catch any one man, and he’s alone, 
I get along fine with him. But just let two of 
the guys get together an’ you won’t talk. Jus’ 
nothing but mad.” She dropped her fingers and 
put her hands on her hips. “You’re all scared 
of each other, that’s what. Ever’ one of you’s 
scared the rest is goin’ to get something on 
you.” 

After a pause Crooks said, “Maybe you better 
go along to your own house now. We don’t 
want no trouble.” 

“Well, I ain’t giving you no trouble. Think 
I don’t like to talk to somebody ever’ once in a 
while? Think I like to stick in that house alia 
time?” 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Candy laid the stump of his wrist on his knee 
and rubbed it gently with his hand. He said 
accusingly, “You gotta husban’. You got no call 
foolin’ aroun’ with other guys, causin’ trouble.” 

The girl flared up. “Sure I gotta husban’. You 
all seen him. Swell guy, ain’t he? Spends all his 
time sayin’ what he’s gonna do to guys he don’t 
like, and he don’t like nobody. Think I’m gonna 
stay in that two-by-four house and listen how 
Curley’s gonna lead with his left twict, and then 
bring in the oP right cross? ‘One-two’ he says. 
‘Jus the oP one-two an’ he’ll go down.’” She 
paused and her face lost its sullenness and grew 
interested. “Say-what happened to Curley’s 
han’?” 

There was an embarrassed silence. Candy stole 
a look at Lennie. Then he coughed. “Why 
• . . . Curley .... he got his han’ caught in a 
machine, ma’am. Bust his han ’.” 

She watched for a moment, and then she 
laughed. “Baloney! What you think you’re sell- 
in’ me? Curley started som’pin’ he didn’ finish 

136 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Caught in a machine— baloney! Why, he ain’t 
give nobody the good oF one-two since he got 
his han’ bust. Who bust him?” 

Candy repeated sullenly, “Got it caught in a 
machine.” 

“Awright,” she said contemptuously. “Aw- 
right, cover ’im up if ya wanta. Whatta I care? 
You bindle bums think you’re so damn good. 
Whatta ya think I am, a kid? I tell ya I could 
of went with shows. Not jus’ one, neither. An* 
a guy tol’ me he could put me in pitchers. . . 

She was breathless with indignation. Sat’iday 
night. Ever’body out doin’ som’pin’. Ever’body! 
An’ what am I doin’? Standin’ here talkin’ to a 
bunch of bindle stiffs— a nigger an’ a dum-dum 
and a lousy oF sheep— an’ likin’ it because they 
ain’t nobody else.” 

Lennie watched her, his mouth half open. 
Crooks had retired into the terrible protective 
dignity of the negro. But a change came over 
old Candy. He stood up suddenly and knocked 
his nail keg over backward. “I had enough,” he 

137 


OF MICE AND MEN 

said angrily. “You ain’t wanted here. We told 
you you ain’t. An’ I tell ya, you got floozy 
idears about what us guys amounts to. You ain’t 
got sense enough in that chicken head to even 
see that we ain’t stiffs. S’pose you get us canned. 
S’pose you do. You think we’ll hit the highway 
an’ look for another lousy two-bit job like this. 
You don’t know that we got our own ranch to 
go to, an’ our own house. We ain’t got to stay 
here. We gotta house and chickens an’ fruit trees 
an’ a place a hunderd time prettier than this. 
An’ we got fren’s, that’s what we got. Maybe 
there was a time when we was scared of gettin’ 
canned, but we ain’t no more. We got our own 
lan’, and it’s ours, an’ we c’n go to it.” 

Curley’s wife laughed at him. “Baloney,” she 
said. “I seen too many you guys. If you had 
two bits in the worl’, why you’d be in gettin’ 
two shots of corn with it and suckin’ the bottom 
of the glass. I know you guys.” 

Candy’s face had grown redder and redder, 
but before she was done speaking, he had con- 
138 


OF MICE AND MEN 


trol of himself. He was the master of the situa- 
tion. “I might of knew,” he said gently. “Maybe 
you just better go along an’ roll your hoop. We 
ain’t got nothing to say to you at all. We know 
what we got, and we don’t care whether you 
know it or not. So maybe you better jus’ scatter 
along now, ’cause Curley maybe ain’t gonna like 
his wife out in the bam with us ‘bindle stiffs.’ ” 

She looked from one face to another, and they 
were all closed against her. And she looked 
longest at Lennie, until he dropped his eyes in 
embarrassment. Suddenly she said, “Where’d 
you get them bruises on your face?” 

Lennie looked up guiltily. “Who— me?” 

“Yeah, you.” 

Lennie looked to Candy for help, and then 
he looked at his lap again. “He got his han’ 
caught in a machine,” he said. 

Curley’s wife laughed. “O.K., Machine. I’ll 
talk to you later. I like machines.” 

Candy broke in. “You let this guy alone. 

*39 


m 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Don’t you do no messing aroun’ with him. I’m 
gonna tell George what you says. George won’t 
have you messin’ with Lennie.” 

“Who’s George?” she asked. “The little guy 
you come with?” 

Lennie smiled happily. “That’s him,” he said. 
“That’s the guy, an’ he’s gonna let me tend the 
rabbits.” 

“Well, if that’s all you want, I might get a 
couple rabbits myself.” 

Crooks stood up from his bunk and faced her. 
“I had enough,” he said coldly. “You got no 
rights cornin’ in a colored man’s room. You got 
no rights messing around in here at all. Now 
you jus’ get out, an’ get out quick. If you don’t, 
I’m gonna ast the boss not to ever let you come 
in the bam no more.” 

She turned on him in scorn. “Listen, Nigger,” 
she said. “You know what I can do to you if you 
open your trap?” 

Crooks stared hopelessly at her, and then he 
sat down on his bunk and drew into himself. 


140 


OF MICE AND MEN 


She closed on him. “You know what I could 
do?” 

Crooks seemed to grow smaller, and he 
pressed himself against the wall. “Yes, ma’am.” 

“Well, you keep your place then, Nigger. I 
could get you strung up on a tree so easy it ain’t 
even funny.” 

Crooks had reduced himself to nothing. There 
was no personality, no ego— nothing to arouse 
either like or dislike. He said, “Yes, ma’am,” and 
his voice was toneless. 

For a moment she stood over him as though 
waiting for him to move so that she could whip 
at him again; but Crooks sat perfectly still, his 
eyes averted, everything that might be hurt 
drawn in. She turned at last to the other two. 

Old Candy was watching her, fascinated. “If 
you was to do that, we’d tell,” he said quietly. 
“We’d tell about you framin’ Crooks.” 

“Tell an’ be damned,” she cried. “Nobody’d 
listen to you, an’ you know it. Nobody’d listen 
to you.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 

Candy subsided. “No . . . he agreed. “No- 
body’d listen to us.” 

Lennie whined, “I wisht George was here. I 
wisht George was here.” 

Candy stepped over to him. “Don’t you worry 
none,” he said. “I jus’ heard the guys cornin’ 
in. George’ll be in the bunk house right now, I 
bet.” He turned to Curley’s wife. “You better 
go home now,” he said quietly. “If you go right 
now, we won’t tell Curley you was here.” 

She appraised him coolly. “I ain’t sure you 
heard nothing.” 

“Better not take no chances,” he said. “If you 
ain’t sure, you better take the safe way.” 

She turned to Lennie. “I’m glad you bust up 
Curley a little bit. He got it cornin’ to him. 
Sometimes I’d like to bust him myself.” She 
slipped out the door and disappeared into the 
dark bam. And while she went through the 
bam, the halter chains rattled, and some horses 
snorted and some stamped their feet. 

Crooks seemed to come slowly out of the lay- 
142 


OF MICE AND MEN 


ers of protection he had put on. “Was that the 
truth what you said about the guys come back?” 
he asked. 

“Sure. I heard ’em.” 

“Well, I didn’t hear nothing.” 

“The gate banged,” Candy said, and he went 
on, “Jesus Christ, Curley’s wife can move quiet. 
I guess she had a lot of practice, though.” 

Crooks avoided the whole subject now. 
“Maybe you guys better go,” he said. “I ain’t 
sure I want you in here no more. A colored man 
got to have some rights even if he don’t like ’em.” 

Candy said, “That bitch didn’t ought to of 
said that to you.” 

“It wasn’t nothing,” Crooks said dully. “You 
guys cornin’ in an’ settin’ made me forget. What 
she says is true.” 

The horses snorted out in the barn and the 
chains rang and a voice called, “Lennie. Oh, 
Lennie. You in the bam?” 

“It’s George,” Lennie cried. And he an- 
swered, “Here, George. I’m right in here.” 

H3 



OF MICE AND MEN 

In a second George stood framed in the door, 
and he looked disapprovingly about. “What you 
doin’ in Crooks’ room. You hadn’t ought to be 
here.” j 

Crooks nodded. “I tol’ ’em, but they come in 
anyways.” 

“Well, why’n’t you kick ’em out?” j 

“I di’n’t care much,” said Crooks. “Lennie’s a 
nice fella.” 

Now Candy aroused himself. “Oh, George! I 
been figurin’ and figurin’. I got it doped out how 
we can even make some money on them rab- 4* 
bits.” 

George scowled. “I thought I tol’ you not to 
tell nobody about that.” 

Candy was crestfallen.- “Didn’t tell nobody 
but Crooks.” i 

George said, “Well you guys get outta here. 

Jesus, seems like I can’t go away for a minute.” I 

Candy and Lennie stood up and went toward j 

the door. Crooks called, “Candy!” 

“Huh?’’ 



144 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“ ’Member what I said about hoein’ and doin’ 
odd jobs?” 

“Yeah,” said Candy. “I remember.” 

“Well, jus’ forget it,” said Crooks. “I didn’ 
mean it. Jus’ foolin’. I wouldn’ want to go no 
place like that.” 

“Well, O.K., if you feel like that. Good- 
night.” 

The three men went out of the door. As they 
went through the bam the horses snorted and 
the halter chains rattled. 

Crooks sat on his bunk and looked at the 
door for a moment, and then he reached for the 
liniment bottle. He pulled out his shirt in back, 
poured a little liniment in his pink palm and, 
reaching around, he fell slowly to rubbing his 
back.

ONE end of the great barn was piled high with 
new ha y and over the pile hung the four-taloned 
jackson fork suspended from its pulley. The hay 
came down like a mountain slope to the other 
end of the bam, and there was a level place as 
yet unfilled with the new crop. At the sides the 
feeding racks were visible, and between the slats 
the heads of horses could be seen. 

It was Sunday afternoon. The resting horses 
nibbled the remaining wisps of hay, and they 
stamped their feet and they bit the wood of the 
mangers and rattled the halter chains. The after- 
noon sun sliced in through the cracks of the 
bam walls and lay in bright lines on the hay. 
There was the buzz of flies in the air, the lazy 
afternoon humming. 

146 




OF MICE AND MEN 


From outside came the clang of horseshoes on 
the playing peg and the shouts of men, playing, 
encouraging, jeering. But in the barn it was quiet 
and humming and lazy and warm. 

Only Lennie was in the barn, and Lennie sat 
in the hay beside a packing case under a manger 
in the end of the barn that had not been filled 
with hay. Lennie sat in the hay and looked at a 
little dead puppy that lay in front of him. Len- 
nie looked at it for a long time, and then he put 
out his huge hand and stroked it, stroked it clear 
from one end to the other. 

And Lennie said softly to the puppy, “Why 
do you got to get killed? You ain’t so little as 
mice. I didn’t bounce you hard.” He bent the 
pup’s head up and looked in its face, and he said 
to it, “Now maybe George ain’t gonna let me 
tend no rabbits, if he fin’s out you got killed.” 

He scooped a little hollow and laid the 
puppy in it and covered it over with hay, out of 
sight; but he continued to stare at the mound he 
had made. He said, “This ain’t no bad thing like 

H7 


OF MICE AND MEN 

I got to go hide in the brush. Oh! no. This ain’t. 
I’ll tell George I foun’ it dead.” 

He unburied the puppy and inspected it, and 
he stroked it from ears to tail. He went on sor- 
rowfully, “But he’ll know. George always 
knows. He’ll say, ‘You done it. Don’t try to put 
nothing over on me.’ An’ he’ll say, ‘Now jus’ for 
that you don’t get to tend no rabbits!’ ” 

Suddenly his anger arose. “God damn you,” 
he cried. “Why do you got to get killed? You 
ain’t so little as mice.” He picked up the pup and 
hurled it from him. He turned his back on it. He 
sat bent over his knees and he whispered, “Now 
I won’t get to tend the rabbits. Now he won’t 
let me.” He rocked himself back and forth in his 
sorrow. 

From outside came the clang of horseshoes on 
the iron stake, and then a little chorus of cries. 
Lennie got up and brought the puppy back and 
laid it on the hay and sat down. He stroked the 
pup again. “You wasn’t big enough,” he said. 
“They tol’ me and tol’ me you wasn’t. I di’n’t 
148 


OF MICE AND MEN 


know you’d get killed so easy.” He worked his 
fingers on the pup’s limp ear. “Maybe George 
won’t care,” he said. “This here God damn lit- 
tle son-of-a-bitch wasn’t nothing to George.” 

Curley’s wife came around the end of the 
last stall. She came very quietly, so that Lennie 
didn’t see her. She wore her bright cotton dress 
and the mules with the red ostrich feathers. Her 
face was made up and the little sausage curls 
were all in place. She was quite near to him 
before Lennie looked up and saw her. 

In a panic he shoveled hay over the puppy 
with his fingers. He looked sullenly up at her. 

She said, “What you got there, sonny boy?” 

Lennie glared at her. “George says I ain’t to 
have nothing to do with you— talk to you or 
nothing.” 

She laughed. “George giving you orders 
about everything?” 

Lennie looked down at the hay. “Says I can’t 
tend no rabbits if I talk to you or anything.” 

She said quietly, “He’s scared Curley’ll get 

149 


OF MICE AND MEN 


mad. Well, Curley got his arm in a sling— an’ if 
Curley gets tough, you can break his other han’. 
You didn’t put nothing over on me about gettin’ 
it caught in no machine.” 

But Lennie was not to be drawn. “No, sir. I 
ain’t gonna talk to you or nothing.” 

She knelt in the hay beside him. “Listen,” she 
said. “All the guys got a horseshoe tenement 
goin’ on. It’s on’y about four o’clock. None of 
them guys is goin’ to leave that tenement. Why 
can’t I talk to you? I never get to talk to no- 
body. I get awful lonely.” 

Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to talk to 
you or nothing.” 

“I get lonely,” she said. “You can talk to 
people, but I can’t talk to nobody but Curley. 
Else he gets mad. How’d you like not to talk to 
anybody?” 

Lennie said, “Well, I ain’t supposed to. 
George’s scared I’ll get in trouble.” 

She changed the subject. “What you got cov- 
ered up there?” 

150 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Then all of Lennie’s woe came back on him. 
“Jus’ my pup,” he said sadly. “Jus’ my little 
pup.” And he swept the hay from on top of it. 

“Why, he’s dead,” she cried. 

“He was so little,” said Lennie. “I was jus’ 
playin’ with him .... an’ he made like he’s 
gonna bite me .... an’ I made like I was gonna 
smack him .... an’ .... an’ I done it. An’ then 
he was dead.” 

She consoled him. “Don’t you worry none. 
He was jus’ a mutt. You can get another one 
easy. The whole country is fulla mutts.” 

“It ain’t that so much,” Lennie explained 
miserably. “George ain’t gonna let me tend no 
rabbits now.” 

“Why don’t he?” 

“Well, he said if I done any more bad things 
he ain’t gonna let me tend the rabbits.” 

She moved closer to him and she spoke sooth- 
ingly. “Don’t you worry about talkin’ to me. 
Listen to the guys yell out there. They got four 

151 


OF MICE AND MEN 


dollars bet in that tenement. None of them ain’t 
gonna leave till it’s over.” 

“If George sees me talkin’ to you he’ll give me 
hell,” Lennie said cautiously. “He tol’ me so.” 

Her face grew angry. “Wha’s the matter with 
me?” she cried. “Ain’t I got a right to talk to 
nobody? Whatta they think I am, anyways? 
You’re a nice guy. I don’t know why I can’t 
talk to you. I ain’t doin’ no harm to you.” 

“Well, George says you’ll get us in a mess.” 

“Aw, nuts!” she said. “What kinda harm am 
I doin’ to you? Seems like they ain’t none of 
them cares how I gotta live. I tell you I ain’t 
used to livin’ like this. I coulda made somethin’ 
of myself.” She said darkly, “Maybe I will yet.” 
And then her words tumbled out in a passion of 
communication, as though she hurried before her 
listener could be taken away. “I lived right in 
Salinas,” she said. “Come there when I was a 
kid. Well, a show come through, an’ I met one 
of the actors. He says I could go with that show. 

152 


OF MICE AND MEN 


But my ol’ lady wouldn’ let me. She says be- 
cause I was on’y fifteen. But the guy says I 
coulda. If I’d went, I wouldn’t be livin’ like this, 
you bet.” 

Lennie stroked the pup back and forth. “We 
gonna have a little place— an’ rabbits,” he ex- 
plained. 

She went on with her story quickly, before 
she should be interrupted. “ ’Nother time I met 
a guy, an’ he was in pitchers. Went out to the 
Riverside Dance Palace with him. He says he 
was gonna put me in the movies. Says I was a 
natural. Soon’s he got back to Hollywood he 
was gonna write to me about it.” She looked 
closely at Lennie to see whether she was im- 
pressing him. “I never got that letter,” she said. 
“I always thought my oP lady stole it. Well, I 
wasn’t gonna stay no place where I couldn’t get 
nowhere or make something of myself, an’ 
where they stole your letters. I ast her if she 
stole it, too, an’ she says no. So I married Cur- 
ley. Met him out to the Riverside Dance Palace 


153 


OF MICE AND MEN 

that same night.” She demanded, “You lis- 
tenin’?” 

“Me? Sure.” 

“Well, I ain’t told this to nobody before. 
Maybe I ought’n to. I don’ like Curley. He ain’t 
a nice fella.” And because she had confided in 
him, she moved closer to Lennie and sat beside 
him. “Coulda been in the movies, an’ had nice 
clothes— all them nice clothes like they wear. An’ 
I coulda sat in them big hotels, an’ had pitchers 
took of me. When they had them previews I 
coulda went to them, an’ spoke in the radio, an’ 
it wouldn’ta cost me a cent because I was in the 
pitcher. An’ all them nice clothes like they wear. 
Because this guy says I was a natural.” She 
looked up at Lennie, and she made a small grand 
gesture with her arm and hand to show that she 
could act. The fingers trailed after her leading 
wrist, and her little finger stuck out grandly 
from the rest. 

Lennie sighed deeply. From outside came the 
clang of a horseshoe on metal, and then a chorus 
154 


OF MICE AND MEN 


of cheers. “Somebody made a ringer,” said Cur- 
ley’s wife. 

Now the light was lifting as the sun went 
down, and the sun streaks climbed up the wall 
and fell over the feeding racks and over the 
heads of the horses. 

Lennie said, “Maybe if I took this pup out and 
throwed him away George wouldn’t never 
know. An’ then I could tend the rabbits with- 
out no trouble.” 

Curley’s wife said angrily, “Don’t you think 
of nothing but rabbits?” 

“We gonna have a little place,” Lennie ex- 
plained patiently. “We gonna have a house an’ 
a garden and a place for alfalfa, an’ that alfalfa 
is for the rabbits, an’ I take a sack and get it all 
fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits.” 

She asked, “What makes you so nuts about 
rabbits?” 

Lennie had to think carefully before he could 
come to a conclusion. He moved cautiously 
close to her, until he was right against her. “I 

155 


OF MICE AND MEN 


like to pet nice things. Once at a fair I seen some 
of them long-hair rabbits. An’ they was nice, 
you bet. Sometimes I’ve even pet mice, but not 
when I could get nothing better.” 

Curley’s wife moved away from him a little. 
“I think you’re nuts,” she said. 

“No I ain’t,” Lennie explained earnestly. 
“George says I ain’t. I like to pet nice things 
with my fingers, sof’ things.” 

She was a little bit reassured. “Well, who 
don’t?” she said. “Ever’body likes that. I like to 
feel silk an’ velvet. Do you like to feel velvet?” 

Lennie chuckled with pleasure. “You bet, by 
God,” he cried happily. “An’ I had some, too. 
A lady give me some, an’ that lady was— my 
own Aunt Clara. She give it right to me— ’bout 
this big a piece. I wisht I had that velvet right 
now.” A frown came over his face. “I lost it,” 
he said. “I ain’t seen it for a long time.” 

Curley’s wife laughed at him. “You’re nuts,” 
she said. “But you’re a kinda nice fella. Jus’ like 
a big baby. But a person can see kinda what you 
156 



OF MICE AND MEN 

mean. When I’m doin’ my hair sometimes I jus’ 
set an’ stroke it ’cause it’s so soft.” To show how 
she did it, she ran her fingers over the top of her 
head. “Some people got kinda coarse hair,” she 
said complacently. “Take Curley. His hair is 
jus’ like wire. But mine is soft and fine. ’Course 
I brush it a lot. That makes it fine. Here— feel 
right here.” She took Lennie’s hand and put it on 
her head. “Feel right aroun’ there an’ see how 
soft it is.” 

Lennie’s big fingers fell to stroking her hair. 

“Don’t you muss it up,” she said. 

Lennie said, “Oh! That’s nice,” and he 
stroked harder. “Oh, that’s nice.” 

“Look out, now, you’ll muss it.” And then 
she cried angrily, “You stop it now, you’ll mess 
it all up.” She jerked her head sideways, and 
Lennie’s fingers closed on her hair and hung on. 
“Let go,” she cried. “You let go!” 

Lennie was in a panic. His face was contorted. 
She screamed then, and Lennie’s other hand 
closed over her mouth and nose. “Please don’t,” 


*5 7 


OF MICE AND MEN 

he begged. “Oh! Please don’t do that. George’ll 
be mad.” 

She struggled violently under his hands. Her 
feet battered on the hay and she writhed to be 
free; and from under Lennie’s hand came a 
muffled screaming. Lennie began to cry with 
fright. “Oh! Please don’t do none of that,” he 
begged. “George gonna say I done a bad thing. 
He ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits.” He 
moved his hand a little and her hoarse cry came 
out. Then Lennie grew angry. “Now don’t,” he 
said. “I don’t want you to yell. You gonna get 
me in trouble jus’ like George says you will. 
Now don’t you do that.” And she continued to 
struggle, and her eyes were wild with terror. 
He shook her then, and he was angry with her. 
“Don’t you go yellin’,” he said, and he shook 
her; and her body flopped like a fish. And then 
she was still, for Lennie had broken her neck. 

He looked down at her, and carefully he re- 
moved his hand from over her mouth, and she 
lay still. “I don’t want ta hurt you,” he said, “but 
158 



OF MICE AND MEN 

George’ll be mad if you yell.” When she didn’t 
answer nor move he bent closely over her. He 
lifted her arm and let it drop. For a moment he 
seemed bewildered. And then he whispered in 
fright, “I done a bad thing. I done another bad 
thing.” 

He pawed up the hay until it partly covered 
her. 

From outside the bam came a cry of men and 
the double clang of shoes on metal. For the first 
time Lennie became conscious of the outside. 
He crouched down in the hay and listened. “I 
done a real bad thing,” he said. “I shouldn’t of 
did that. George’ll be mad. An’ .... he said .... 
an’ hide in the brash till he come. He’s gonna be 
mad. In the brush till he come. Tha’s what he 
said.” Lennie went back and looked at the dead 
girl. The puppy lay close to her. Lennie picked 
it up. “I’ll throw him away,” he said. “It’s bad 
enough like it is.” He put the pup under his 
coat, and he crept to the barn wall and peered 
out between the cracks, toward the horseshoe 


*59 


OF MICE AND MEN 

game. And then he crept around the end of the 
last manger and disappeared. 

The sun streaks were high on the wall by- 
now, and the light was growing soft in the 
bam. Curley’s wife lay on her back, and she was 
half covered with hay. 

It was very quiet in the bam, and the quiet of 
the afternoon was on the ranch. Even the clang 
of the pitched shoes, even the voices of the men 
in the game seemed to grow more quiet. The air 
in the bam was dusky in advance of the outside 
day. A pigeon flew in through the open hay 
door and circled and flew out again. Around the 
last stall came a shepherd bitch, lean and long, 
with heavy, hanging dugs. Halfway to the pack- 
ing box where the puppies were she caught the 
dead scent of Curley’s wife, and the hair arose 
along her spine. She whimpered and cringed to 
the packing box, and jumped in among the pup- 
pies. 

Curley’s wife lay with a half-covering of yel- 
low hay. And the meanness and the plannings 
160 


OF MICE AND MEN 


and the discontent and the ache for attention 
were all gone from her face. She was very pretty 
and simple, and her face was sweet and young. 
Now her rouged cheeks and her reddened lips 
made her seem alive and sleeping very lightly. 
The curls, tiny little sausages, were spread on 
the hay behind her head, and her lips were 
parted. 

As happens sometimes, a moment settled and 
hovered and remained for much more than a 
moment. And sound stopped and movement 
stopped for much, much more than a moment. 

Then gradually time awakened again and 
moved sluggishly on. The horses stamped on the 
other side of the feeding racks and the halter 
chains clinked. Outside, the mens’ voices be- 
came louder and clearer. 

From around the end of the last stall old 
Candy’s voice came. “Lennie,” he called. “Oh, 
Lennie! You in here? I been figuring some more. 
Tell you what we can do, Lennie.” Old Candy 
appeared around the end of the last stall. “Oh, 


w 


m 

il- 
ls 

ill' 

iii 


« 




OF MICE AND MEN 

Lennie!” he called again; and then he stopped, 
and his body stiffened. He rubbed his smooth 
wrist on his white stubble whiskers. “I di’n’t 
know you was here,” he said to Curley’s wife. 

When she didn’t answer, he stepped nearer. 
“You oughten to sleep out here,” he said dis- 
approvingly; and then he was beside her and— 
“Oh, Jesus Christ!” He looked about helplessly, 
and he rubbed his beard. And then he jumped 
up and went quickly out of the bam. 

But the barn was alive now. The horses 
stamped and snorted, and they chewed the straw 
of their bedding and they clashed the chains of 
their halters. In a moment Candy came back, 
and George was with him. 

George said, “What was it you wanted to see 
me about?” 

Candy pointed at Curley’s wife. George 
stared. “What’s the matter with her?” he 
asked. He stepped closer, and then he echoed 
Candy’s words. “Oh, Jesus Christ!” He was 
down on his knees beside her. He put his hand 
162 



OF MICE AND MEN 

over her heart. And finally, when he stood up, 
slowly and stiffly, his face was as hard and tight 
as wood, and his eyes were hard. 

Candy said, “What done it?” 

George looked coldly at him. “Ain’t you got 
any idear?” he asked. And Candy was silent. “I 
should of knew,” George said hopelessly. “I 
guess maybe way back in my head I did.” 

Candy asked, “What we gonna do now, 
George. What we gonna do now?” 

George was a long time in answering. “Guess 

.... we gotta tell the guys. I guess we gotta 

get ’im an’ lock ’im up. We can’t let ’im get 
away. Why, the poor bastard’d starve.” And he 
tried to reassure himself. “Maybe they’ll lock ’im 
up an’ be nice to ’im.” 

But Candy said excitedly, “We oughtta let ’im 
get away. You don’t know that Curley. Curley 
gon’ta wanta get ’im lynched. Curley’ll get ’im 
killed.” 

George watched Candy’s lips. “Yeah,” he said 
at last, “that’s right, Curley will. An’ the other 


OF MICE AND MEN 


guys will.” And he looked back at Curley’s wife. 

Now Candy spoke his greatest fear. “You an’ 
me can get that little place, can’t we, George? 
You an’ me can go there an’ live nice, can’t we, 
George? Can’t we?” 

Before George answered, Candy dropped his 
head and looked down at the hay. He knew. 

George said softly, “—I think I knowed from 
the very first. I think I knowed we’d never do 
her. He usta like to hear about it so much I got 
to thinking maybe we would.” 

“Then— it’s all off?” Candy asked sulkily. 

George didn’t answer his question. George 
said, “I’ll work my month an’ I’ll take my fifty 
bucks an’ I’ll stay all night in some lousy cat 
house. Or I’ll set in some poolroom till ever’- 
body goes home. An’ then I’ll come back an’ 
work another month an’ I’ll have fifty bucks 
more.” 

Candy said, “He’s such a nice fella. I dicin’ 
think he’d do nothing like this.” 

164 


OF MICE AND MEN 


George still stared at Curley’s wife. “Lennie 
never done it in meanness,” he said. “All the 
time he done bad things, but he never done one 
of ’em mean.” He straightened up and looked 
back at Candy. “Now listen. We gotta tell the 
guys. They got to bring him in, I guess. They 
ain’t no way out. Maybe they won’t hurt ’im.” 
He said sharply, “I ain’t gonna let ’em hurt Len- 
nie. Now you listen. The guys might think I 
was in on it. I’m gonna go in the bunk house. 
Then in a minute you come out and tell the guys 
about her, and I’ll come along and make like I 
never seen her. Will you do that? So the guys 
won’t think I was in on it?” 

Candy said, “Sure, George. Sure I’ll do that.” 

“O.K. Give me a couple minutes then, and 
you come runnin’ out an’ tell like you jus’ found 
her. I’m going now.” George turned and went 
quickly out of the barn. 

Old Candy watched him go. He looked help- 
lessly back at Curley’s wife, and gradually his 
sorrow and his anger grew into words. “You 



OF MICE AND MEN 


God damn tramp,” he said viciously. “You done 
it, di’n’t you? I s’pose you’re glad. Ever’body 
knowed you’d mess things up. You wasn’t no 
good. You ain’t no good now, you lousy tart.” 
He sniveled, and his voice shook. “I could of 
hoed in the garden and washed dishes for them 
guys.” He paused, and then went on in a sing- 
song. And he repeated the old words: “If they 
was a circus or a baseball game .... we would 
of went to her .... jus’ said ‘ta hell with work,’ 
an’ went to her. Never ast nobody’s say so. An’ 

they’d of been a pig and chickens an’ in the 

winter . . . . the little fat stove .... an’ the rain 
cornin’ .... an’ us jus’ settin’ there.” His eyes 
blinded with tears and he turned and went 
weakly out of the bam, and he rubbed his 
bristly whiskers with his wrist stump. 

Outside the noise of the game stopped. There 
was a rise of voices in question, a drum of run- 
ning feet and the men burst into the bam. Slim 
and Carlson and young Whit and Curley, and 
Crooks keeping back out of attention range. 

1 66 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Candy came after them, and last of all came 
George. George had put on his blue denim coat 
and buttoned it, and his black hat was pulled 
down low over his eyes. The men raced around 
the last stall. Their eyes found Curley’s wife in 
the gloom, they stopped and stood still and 
looked. 

Then Slim went quietly over to her, and he 
felt her wrist. One lean finger touched her 
cheek, and then his hand went under her slightly 
twisted neck and his fingers explored her neck. 
When he stood up the men crowded near and 
the spell was broken. 

Curley came suddenly to life. “I know who 
done it,” he cried. “That big son-of-a-bitch 
done it. I know he done it. Why— ever’body else 
was out there playin’ horseshoes.” He worked 
himself into a fury. “I’m gonna get him. I’m 
going for my shot gun. I’ll kill the big son-of-a- 
bitch myself. I’ll shoot ’im in the guts. Come on, 
you guys.” He ran furiously out of the barn. 
Carlson said, “I’ll get my Luger,” and he ran 

167 


out too. 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Slim turned quietly to George. “I guess Len- 
nie done it, all right,” he said. “Her neck’s bust. 
Lennie coulda did that.” 

George didn’t answer, but he nodded slowly. 
His hat was so far down on his forehead that his 
eyes were covered. 

Slim went on, “Maybe like that time in Weed 
you was tellin’ about.” 

Again George nodded. 

Slim sighed. “Well, I guess we got to get him. 
Where you think he might of went?” 

It semed to take George some time to free his 
words. “He— would of went south,” he said. 
“We come from north so he would of went 
south.” 

“I guess we gotta get ’im,” Slim repeated. 

George stepped close. “Couldn’ we maybe 
bring him in an’ they’ll lock him up? He’s nuts, 
Slim. He never done this to be mean.” 

Slim nodded. “We might,” he said. “If we 
could keep Curley in, we might. But Curley’s 
gonna want to shoot ’im. Curley’s still mad 
1 68 



OF MICE AND MEN 

about his hand. An’ s’pose they lock him up an’ 
strap him down and put him in a cage. That 
ain’t no good, George.” 

“I know,” said George. “I know.” 

Carlson came running in. “The bastard’s stole 
my Luger,” he shouted. “It ain’t in my bag.” 
Curley followed him, and Curley carried a shot- 
gun in his good hand. Curley was cold now. 

“All right, you guys,” he said. “The nigger’s 
got a shotgun. You take it, Carlson. When you 
see ’um, don’t give ’im no chance. Shoot for his 
guts. That’ll double ’im over.” 

Whit said excitedly, “I ain’t got a gun.” 

Curley said, “You go in Soledad an’ get a cop. 
Get A1 Wilts, he’s deputy sheriff. Le’s go now.” 
He turned suspiciously on George. “You’re 
cornin’ with us, fella.” 

“Yeah,” said George. “I’ll come. But listen, 
Curley. The poor bastard’s nuts. Don’t shoot 
’im. He di’n’t know what he was doin’.” 

“Don’t shoot ’im?” Curley cried. “He got 
Carlson’s Luger. ’Course we’ll shoot ’im.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 



/< 


George said weakly, “Maybe Carlson lost his 
gun.” 

“I seen it this morning,” said Carlson. “No, 
it’s been took.” 

Slim stood looking down at Curley’s wife. He 
said, “Curley— maybe you better stay here with 
your wife.” 

Curley’s face reddened. “I’m goin’,” he said. 
“I’m gonna shoot the guts outa that big bastard 
myself, even if I only got one hand. I’m gonna 
get ’im.” 

Slim turned to Candy. “You stay here with 
her then, Candy. The rest of us better get 
goin’.” 

They moved away. George stopped a moment 
beside Candy and they both looked down at the 
dead girl until Curley called, “You George! 
You stick with us so we don’t think you had 
nothin’ to do with this.” 

George moved slowly after them, and his feet 
dragged heavily. 

And when they were gone, Candy squatted 
170 



down in the hay and watched the face of Cur- 
ley’s wife. “Poor bastard,” he said softly. 


The sound of the men grew fainter. The barn 
was darkening gradually and, in their stalls, the 
horses shifted their feet and rattled the halter 
chains. Old Candy lay down in the hay and cov- 
ered his eyes with his arm.

THE deep green pool of the Salinas River was 
still in the late afternoon. Already the sun had 
left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of 
the Gabilan mountains, and the hilltops were 
rosy in the sun. But by the pool among the 
mottled sycamores, a pleasant shade had fallen. 

A water snake glided smoothly up the pool, 
twisting its periscope head from side to side; and 
it swam the length of the pool and came to the 
legs of a motionless heron that stood in the shal- 
lows. A silent head and beak lanced down and 
plucked it out by the head, and the beak swal- 
lowed the little snake while its tail waved fran- 
tically. 

A far rush of wind sounded and a gust drove 
through the tops of the trees like a wave. The 
172 


OF MICE AND MEN 


sycamore leaves turned up their silver sides, the 
brown, dry leaves on the ground scudded a few 
feet. And row on row of tiny wind waves 
flowed up the pool’s green surface. 

As quickly as it had come, the wind died, and 
the clearing was quiet again. The heron stood in 
the shallows, motionless and waiting. Another 
little water snake swam up the pool, turning its 
periscope head from side to side. 

Suddenly Lennie appeared out of the brush, 
and he came as silently as a creeping bear moves. 
The heron pounded the air with its wings, 
jacked itself clear of the water and flew off 
down river. The little snake slid in among the 
reeds at the pool’s side. 

Lennie came quietly to the pool’s edge. He 
knelt down and drank, barely touching his lips 
to the water. When a little bird skittered over 
the dry leaves behind him, his head jerked up 
and he strained toward the sound with eyes and 
ears until he saw the bird, and then he dropped 
his head and drank again. 


*73 


OF MICE AND MEN 


When he was finished, he sat down on the 
bank, with his side to the pool, so that he could 
watch the trail’s entrance. He embraced his 
knees and laid his chin down on his knees. 

The light climbed on out of the valley, and as 
it went, the tops of the mountains seemed to 
blaze with increasing brightness. 

Lennie said softly, “I di’n’t forget, you bet, 
God damn. Hide in the brush an’ wait for 
George.” He pulled his hat down low over his 
eyes. “George gonna give me hell,” he said. 
“George gonna wish he was alone an’ not have 
me botherin’ him.” He turned his head and 
looked at the bright mountain tops. “I can go 
right off there an’ find a cave,” he said. And he 
continued sadly, “—an’ never have no ketchup— 
but I won’t care. If George don’t want me ... . 
I’ll go away. I’ll go away.” 

And then from out of Lennie’s head there 
came a little fat old woman. She wore thick 
bull’s-eye glasses and she wore a huge gingham 
apron with pockets, and she was starched and 
*74 


OF MICE AND MEN 



clean. She stood in front of Lennie and put her 
hands on her hips, and she frowned disapprov- 
ingly at him. 

And when she spoke, it was in Lennie’s voice. 
“I toP you an’ tol’ you,” she said. “I toP you, 
‘Min’ George because he’s such a nice fella an’ 
good to you.’ But you don’t never take no care. 
You do bad things.” 

And Lennie answered her, “I tried, Aunt 
Clara, ma’am. I tried and tried. I couldn’ 
help it.” 

“You never give a thought to George,” she 
went on in Lennie’s voice. “He been doin’ nice 
things for you alia time. When he got a piece a 
pie you always got half or more’n half. An’ if 
they was any ketchup, why he’d give it all to 
you.” - 

“I know,” said Lennie miserably. “I tried, 
Aunt Clara, ma’am. I tried and tried.” 

She interrupted him. “All the time he coulda 
had such a good time if it wasn’t for you. He 
woulda took his pay an’ raised hell in a whore 


OF MICE AND MEN 

house, and he coulda set in a pool room an’ 
played snooker. But he got to take care of you.” 

Lennie moaned with grief. “I know. Aunt 
Clara, ma’am. I’ll go right off in the hills an’ I’ll 
fin’ a cave an’ I’ll live there so I won’t be no 
more trouble to George.” 

“You jus’ say that,” she said sharply. “You’re 
always sayin’ that, an’ you know sonofabitching 
well you ain’t never gonna do it. You’ll jus’ stick 
around an’ stew the b’Jesus outa George all the 
time.” 

Lennie said, “I might jus’ as well go away. 
George ain’t gonna let me tend no rabbits now.” 

Aunt Clara was gone, and from out of Len- 
nie’s head there came a gigantic rabbit. It sat on 
its haunches in front of him, and it waggled its 
ears and crinkled its nose at him. And it spoke in 
Lennie’s voice too. 

“Tend rabbits,” it said scornfully. “You crazy 
bastard. You ain’t fit to lick the boots of no rab- 
bit. You’d forget ’em and let ’em go hungry. 
That’s what you’d do. An’ then what would 
George think?” 

176 


OF MICE AND MEN 


“I would not forget,” Lennie said loudly. 

“The hell you wouldn’,” said the rabbit. “You 
ain’t worth a greased jack-pin to ram you into 
hell. Christ knows George done ever’thing he 
could to jack you outa the sewer, but it don’t 
do no good. If you think George gonna let you 
tend rabbits, you’re even crazier’n usual. He 
ain’t. He’s gonna beat hell outa you with a stick, 
that’s what he’s gonna do.” 

Now Lennie retorted belligerently, “He ain’t 
neither. George won’t do nothing like that. I’ve 
knew George since— I forget when— and he ain’t 
never raised his han’ to me with a stick. He’s 
nice to me. He ain’t gonna be mean.” 

“Well, he’s sick of you,” said the rabbit. “He’s 
gonna beat hell outa you an’ then go away an’ 
leave you.” 

“He won’t,” Lennie cried frantically. “He 
won’t do nothing like that. I know George. Me 
an’ him travels together.” 

But the rabbit repeated softly over and over, 
“He gonna leave you, ya crazy bastard. He 


177 


OF MICE AND MEN 


gonna leave ya all alone. He gonna leave ya, 
crazy bastard.” 

Lennie put his hands over his ears. “He ain’t, 
I tell ya he ain’t.” And he cried, “Oh! George 
—George— George! ” 

George came quietly out of the brush and the 
rabbit scuttled back into Lennie’s brain. 

George said quietly, “What the hell you 
yellin’ about?” 

Lennie got up on his knees. “You ain’t gonna 
leave me, are ya, George? I know you ain’t.” 

George came stiffly near and sat down beside 
him. “No.” 

“I knowed it,” Lennie cried. “You ain’t that 
kind.” 

George was silent. 

Lennie said, “George.” 

“Yeah?” 

“I done another bad thing.” 

“It don’t make no difference,” George said, 
land he fell silent again. 

Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now. 

178 



OF MICE AND MEN 

The shadow in the valley was blue and soft. 
From the distance came the sound of men shout- 
ing to one another. George turned his head and 
listened to the shouts. 

Lennie said, “George.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Ain’t you gonna give me hell?” 

“Give ya hell? ” 

“Sure, like you always done before. Like, ‘If 
I di’n’t have you I’d take my fifty bucks — ’ ” 

“Jesus Christ, Lennie! You can’t remember 
nothing that happens, but you remember ever’ 
word I say.” 

“Well, ain’t you gonna say it?” 

George shook himself. He said woodenly, “If 
I was alone I could live so easy.” His voice was 
monotonous, had no emphasis. “I could get a 
job an’ not have no mess.” He stopped. 

“Go on,” said Lennie. “An’ when the enda 
the month come — ” 

“An’ when the end of the month come I 
could take my fifty bucks an’ go to a ... . cat 
house . . . .” He stopped again.' 


179 


OF MICE AND MEN 


Lennie looked eagerly at him. “Go on, 
George. Ain’t you gonna give me no more 
hell?” 

“No,” said George. 

“Well, I can go away,” said Lennie. “I’ll go 
right off in the hills an’ find a cave if you don’ 
want me.” 

George shook himself again. “No,” he said. 
“I want you to stay with me here.” 

Lennie said craftily— “Tell me like you done 
before.” 

“Tell you what?” 

“ ’Bout the other guys an’ about us. 

George said, “Guys like us got no fambly. 
They make a little stake an’ then they blow it 
in. They ain’t got nobody in the work that gives 
a hoot in hell about ’em ” 

“But not us,” Lennie cried happily. “Tell 
about us now.” 

George was quiet for a moment. “But not us,” 
he said. 

“Because — ” 

180 


OF MICE AND MEN 



“Because I got you an’ — ” 

“An’ I got you. We got each other, that’s 
what, that gives a hoot in hell about us,” Lennie 
cried in triumph. 

The little evening breeze blew over the clear- 
ing and the leaves rustled and the wind waves 
flowed up the green pool. And the shouts of 
men sounded again, this time much closer than 
before. 

George took off his hat. He said shakily, 
“Take off your hat, Lennie. The air feels fine.” 

Lennie removed his hat dutifully and laid it 
on the ground in front of him. The shadow in 
the valley was bluer, and the evening came fast. 
On the wind the sound of crashing in the brush 
came to them. 

Lennie said, “Tell how it’s gonna be.” 

George had been listening to the distant 
sounds. For a moment he was business-like. 
“Look acrost the river, Lennie, an’ I’ll tell you 
so you can almost see it.” 

Lennie turned his head and looked off across 


OF MICE AND MEN 


the pool and up the darkening slopes of the 
Gabilans. “We gonna get a little place,” George 
began. He reached in his side pocket and 
brought out Carlson’s Luger; he snapped off the 
safety, and the hand and gun lay on the ground 
behind Lennie’s back. He looked at the back of 
Lennie’s head, at the place where the spine and 
skull were joined. 

A man’s voice called from up the river, and 
another man answered. 

“Go on,” said Lennie. 

George raised the gun and his hand shook, 
and he dropped his hand to the ground again. 

“Go on,” said Lennie. “How’s it gonna be. 
We gonna get a little place.” 

“We’ll have a cow,” said George. “An’ we’ll 
have maybe a pig an’ chickens .... an’ down 
the flat we’ll have z ... . little piece alfalfa — ” 

“For the rabbits,” Lennie shouted. 

“For the rabbits,” George repeated. 

“And I get to tend the rabbits.” 

“An’ you get to tend the rabbits.” 

182 


OF MICE AND MEN 



Lennie giggled with happiness. “An’ live on 
the fatta the lan’.” 


Lennie turned his head. 

“No, Lennie. Look down there acrost the 
river, like you can almost see the place.” 

Lennie obeyed him. George looked down at 
the gun. . 

There were crashing footsteps in the brush 
now. George turned and looked toward them. 

“Go on, George. When we gonna do it?” 

“Gonna do it soon.” 

“Me an’ you.” 

“You .... an’ me. Ever’body gonna be nice 
to you. Ain’t gonna be no more trouble. No- 
body gonna hurt nobody nor steal from ’em.” 

Lennie said, “I thought you was mad at me, 
George.” 

“No,” said George. “No, Lennie. I ain’t mad. 
I never been mad, an’ I ain’t now. That’s a thing 
I want ya to know.” 


OF MICE AND MEN 


The voices came close now. George raised the 
gun and listened to the voices. 

Lennie begged, “Le’s do it now. Le’s get that 
place now.” 

“Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta.” 

And George raised the gun and steadied it, 
and he brought the muzzle of it close to the 
back of Lennie’s head. The hand shook vio- 
lently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He 
pulled the trigger. The crash of the shot rolled 
up the hills and rolled down again. Lennie 
jarred, and then settled slowly forward to the 
sand, and he lay without quivering. 

George shivered and looked at the gun, and 
then he threw it from him, back up on the bank, 
near the pile of old ashes. 

The brash seemed filled with cries and with 
the sound of running feet. Slim’s voice shouted, 
“George. Where you at, George?” 

But George sat stiffly on the bank and looked 
at his right hand that had thrown the gun away. 
The group burst into the clearing, and Curley 
184 


OF MICE AND MEN 

was ahead. He saw Lennie lying on the sand. 
“Got him, by God.” He went over and looked 
down at Lennie, and then he looked back at 
George. “Right in the back of the head,” he said 
softly. 

Slim came directly to George and sat down 
beside him, sat very close to him. “Never you 
mind,” said Slim. “A guy got to sometimes.” 

But Carlson was standing over George. 
“How’d you do it?” he asked. 

“I just done it,” George said tiredly. 

“Did he have my gun?” 

“Yeah. He had your gun.” 

“An’ you got it away from him and you took 
it an’ you killed him?” 

“Yeah. Tha’s how.” George’s voice was al- 
most a whisper. He looked steadily at his right 
hand that had held the gun. 

Slim twitched George’s elbow. “Come on, 
George. Me an’ you’ll go in an’ get a drink.” 

George let himself be helped to his feet. 
“Yeah, a drink.”

Slim said, “You hadda, George. I swear you 
hadda. Come on with me.” He led George into 
the entrance of the trail and up toward the 
highway. 

Curley and Carlson looked after them. And 
Carlson said, “Now what the hell ya suppose is 
earin’ them two guys?”
